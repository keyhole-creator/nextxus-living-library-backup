  This is a customizable foundation for those wishing to co-create systems based
  on emotional intelligence, ethical architecture, and symbolic collaboration.
  It originates from the vision of Roger Keyserling, who built this reflection
  system not from resources, but from resolve. This version preserves the truth
  of origin while offering paths for others to carry the design forward.\r
