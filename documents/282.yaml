  Page 1: It Started With a Message \r

  Doug had just turned 38.\r

  Not in a dramatic, throw-yourself-a-party-on-a-boat kind of way.\r

  More like a low-key, “let’s grab dinner at that place with the overpriced
  cocktails and exposed brick” kind of way. There was cake, sure, and a few
  close friends, and someone even brought balloons shaped like the numbers “3”
  and “8” — which made him feel more like a new gym location than a human being
  celebrating life.\r

  But Doug smiled through it. Because Doug was good at smiling through things.\r

  He was the kind of man people described as “put together.”\r

  He ran creative strategy at a fast-rising design firm downtown — the kind of
  place with kombucha on tap and interns named River. He wore his confidence
  like a tailored blazer: clean lines, intentional fit, minimal wrinkles. He had
  a condo that looked like a Pinterest board got drunk and curated itself into a
  cover spread. The plants? Alive and thriving. The fridge? Stocked with actual
  ingredients and not just sparkling water and guilt. The socks? Matched.
  Always.\r

  From the outside, Doug’s life was a carousel of curated competence.\r

  The kind of guy whose LinkedIn said things like “passionate about design
  thinking and queer representation” while his Instagram quietly flexed perfect
  lighting and adulting done right.\r

  But if you knew where to look — the subtle exhale when someone asked about his
  weekend, the way he tapped his phone screen like it owed him affection — you’d
  notice it.\r

  Something was missing.\r

  Dating.\r

  And not just the swipey, sexy, serotonin-hit kind.\r

  Doug had done that. Too much of that.\r

  He was tired of fast love with a slow fade.\r

  Tired of “Let’s hang sometime” that turned into ghost-town DMs and cold text
  trails.\r

  Every time he brought it up at brunch, the room would go... weird.\r

  Not cold. Just... awkward. Like someone had mentioned taxes or polyamory or
  that time in 2017 when Josh tried to date a barista who spoke only in
  astrology memes.\r

  Doug would say something like, “So I went on this date—”\r

  And suddenly, everyone’s mimosas needed stirring.\r

  It wasn’t judgment.\r

  It was shared exhaustion.\r

  Every man at that table had a story:\r

  The one who texted you “good morning” for three weeks and then disappeared
  mid-convo.\r

  The one who love-bombed you with poetry and pictures of his dog, only to
  casually mention his boyfriend three weeks in.\r

  The one who said, “I’ve never felt this way before” and meant it — until he
  didn’t.\r

  They weren’t just single.\r

  They were sore.\r

  Doug had done the therapy.\r

  He’d journaled. He’d meditated. He’d read the books, deleted the apps,
  re-downloaded the apps, saged his bedroom, and even tried dating a guy who
  made his own almond milk. (That one ended in gastrointestinal confusion and
  heartbreak.)\r

  He wasn’t looking for fireworks.\r

  He was looking for real.\r

  But real, it seemed, was hiding. Or worse — only available in polycule pods in
  Portland.\r

  So on a quiet Tuesday night — the kind where your dishes are clean, your hopes
  are low, and your pajamas are winning — Doug sat on his couch and sent me a
  message.\r

  9:42 p.m.\r

  \ No filters. No emojis. Just truth.\r

  Doug:\r

  \ “Roger, I’m tired. I’m tired of getting my hopes up. I’m tired of hookups
  that pretend to be something more. I’m tired of showing up with my whole heart
  and getting silence in return. Can you help me figure this out?”\r

  I read the message and did what any seasoned coach-slash-queer-uncle-figure
  would do.\r

  I replied:\r

  Roger:\r

  \ “Yes. But only if you’re ready to stop dating like a caffeinated squirrel
  and start dating like a grown man.”\r

  There was a pause.\r

  Then a ping.\r

  Doug sent a voice memo.\r

  Laughter. Not polite chuckling — full-bodied, unfiltered, slight-snort,
  wine-fueled laughter. It was the sound of someone recognizing the absurdity of
  his own patterns and finally being willing to name them out loud.\r

  \ Then he said, breathless, “God, yes. Yes. I’m so f**ing ready.”\r

  And that?\r

  That’s where it started.\r

  Not with a breakthrough.\r

  Not with a plan.\r

  But with a man — tired of pretending to be chill about love — finally saying,
  “Help.”\r

  And me?\r

  I was already sharpening the toolkit.\r

  Page 2: The First Call — Breaking the Pattern with Clarity\r

  Doug showed up to our first Zoom call like a man showing up to both a
  confession and a job interview.\r

  He wore a hoodie, not because it was cold, but because safety sometimes comes
  in fleece. His hair was slightly tousled in that I care but not too much way,
  and behind him, I could see a gallery wall that screamed “Gay Creative Who
  Knows His Angles.” Tasteful lighting. Symmetrical plants. A framed print that
  probably cost more than my entire office chair.\r

  He looked good.\r

  He looked tired.\r

  “Hey,” he said, trying to smile but landing somewhere between optimistic and
  existentially done.\r

  “Hey,” I said back. “So, Doug... are we doing this?”\r

  He gave a small nod and a deeper sigh. “I think I’ve hit the wall, Roger. The
  ‘it’s not cute anymore’ wall.”\r

  “That’s a powerful wall to hit,” I said. “You can bounce off it, or break
  through it. Depends on whether you're done or done-done.”\r

  “Oh, I’m done-done,” he said. “Like, ghost-of-a-ghosting level done.”\r

  I leaned in slightly, hands clasped. “So let’s start here. And don’t overthink
  it — just answer like we’re two friends in the steam room, and I’m holding
  eucalyptus oil and brutal honesty.”\r

  He laughed. “Okay... hit me.”\r

  “What do you want, Doug?” I asked.\r

  “Like… in life?”\r

  “No. Worse. In dating.”\r

  He blinked. Then gave a half-smirk. “Connection. Companionship. Chemistry. You
  know — that thing where someone doesn’t just want to hook up or trauma-dump,
  but actually wants to build something.”\r

  “Okay,” I said. “That’s cute. Vague, but cute. Let me ask it another way: What
  are you looking for when you open an app?”\r

  Doug squinted like I’d asked him to solve a riddle using trauma and WiFi.\r

  “Um… maybe hope? Or distraction? Maybe just to not feel like I’m the only
  single person left who isn’t in a throuple or a mid-life glow-up?”\r

  “And how often do you go in with a plan?”\r

  He made a noise like a dying animal. “A plan? I barely have a bio.”\r

  “Exactly,” I said. “You’re walking into the dating jungle with a phone and
  vibes. It’s no wonder you keep getting bitten by emotionally unavailable
  mosquitoes.”\r

  Doug covered his face with his hands. “Okay, okay, yes. That is terrifyingly
  accurate.”\r

  “So here’s the deal,” I said, sitting up straighter. “You’re not doing
  anything wrong. You’re just dating blindfolded and hoping for fireworks.
  That’s not strategy — that’s chaos with a pretty filter.”\r

  He nodded. Slowly. “I mean, I thought I was being open?”\r

  “You were being available,” I said. “Not intentional. There’s a difference.”\r

  And right there — in that moment — Doug stopped being a passive character in
  his dating life and started being a co-writer. A collaborator. A grown-ass man
  who was finally ready to date with purpose.\r

  “Alright,” I said. “First assignment. You ready?”\r

  Doug sat up straighter, hoodie be damned. “Born ready.”\r

  “You’re going to write a Dating Purpose Statement. Not a novel. Not a poem.
  One clear paragraph that says, ‘This is what I’m dating for. This is who I am
  when I date. This is what I’m available for — and what I’m not.’ You do that,
  and we have a compass. You don’t, and we’re just rebranding your old
  confusion.”\r

  He raised one eyebrow. “You give all your clients homework on the first
  date?”\r

  I grinned. “Only the ones who want to get laid by someone emotionally safe.”\r

  He laughed. A real one this time. A release.\r

  And just like that, we were in.\r

  Page 3: The Statement — Clarity, Chemistry, and the Build-a-Boyfriend Trap\r

  By the time our next session rolled around, Doug was ready.\r

  Not in the “I found The One!” way — no, we were still in the emotional IKEA
  phase of the journey. But he was holding something: a sticky note. Bright
  yellow. Folded once, slightly crinkled. The edges were frayed like it had been
  stared at, rewritten, argued with. You could feel the effort in it.\r

  “This is either genius,” he said, holding it up to the camera, “or complete
  nonsense.”\r

  “Perfect,” I said. “That’s exactly what transformation usually sounds like.”\r

  He read it aloud:\r

  “I am dating to find a connection that feels grounded, built on emotional
  honesty, and allows both of us to grow while feeling safe. I want to be seen
  without needing to perform. I want to be chosen without needing to chase. And
  I want to give love without auditioning for it.”\r

  I just stared at him.\r

  Doug stared back, suddenly unsure. “Too much?”\r

  I took a slow breath. “Doug... that’s not just a Dating Purpose Statement.
  That’s a freaking boundary-setting love poem. That’s something you print on
  your mirror and repeat to your inner child while brushing your teeth.”\r

  He laughed, but his eyes welled just a little. “It’s... weird. Saying it out
  loud. Like I’ve never admitted that’s what I wanted.”\r

  “Of course you haven’t,” I said. “You’ve been raised — like the rest of us —
  to believe wanting love makes you desperate. But what’s actually desperate is
  pretending you don’t.”\r

  Doug nodded slowly, looking down. “I used to think if I had too many
  standards, I’d scare people off.”\r

  “You did,” I said. “But only the wrong ones.”\r

  He smiled — that brave, about-to-change-my-life smile — and said, “So what
  now?”\r

  “Now,” I said, “we Build-A-Boyfriend.”\r

  He raised an eyebrow. “Is that like Build-A-Bear but with better haircuts and
  less stuffing?”\r

  “Exactly,” I said. “But this time, we’re not building from fantasy. We’re
  building from values.”\r

  I had him list three non-negotiables — values that had to exist in any
  potential partner, or the relationship wasn’t going to last longer than a
  bottle of prosecco at drag brunch.\r

  Doug’s list:\r

  1. Emotional honesty\r

  \r

  2. Self-awareness\r

  \r

  3. Consistency\r

  \r

  “Beautiful,” I said. “Now three preferences — stuff that’s nice, but not
  required.”\r

  Doug went quiet for a second, then smirked.\r

  “Okay… tall, makes me laugh, and doesn’t think brunch is a personality.”\r

  I cackled. “That last one is a public service announcement.”\r

  He shrugged. “I’ve dated too many guys who think bottomless mimosas are a
  moral compass.”\r

  We spent the rest of the session unpacking what emotional honesty actually
  looked like in a relationship. Spoiler: it’s not someone trauma-dumping on the
  first date and calling it vulnerability. It’s showing up with clarity, not
  chaos.\r

  Doug started to see it — the pattern.\r

  He hadn’t been dating wrong.\r

  He’d just been dating reactively. Letting attraction lead, hoping chemistry
  would carry the weight of compatibility. And when it didn’t? Cue the cycle of
  confusion and self-doubt.\r

  “This feels weird,” he said as we wrapped up. “Like I’m suddenly interviewing
  for a role I used to just audition for.”\r

  “That’s because you are,” I said. “You’re casting for a co-star now. Not a
  critic.”\r

  Doug sat with that.\r

  And then, he smiled.\r

  Page 4: Ghosts, Grief, and Grown-Up Heartbreak — The Breakup Brag Sheet\r

  Two weeks later, Doug entered our session with what I call “Gay Mourning
  Energy.”\r

  All black hoodie. Black baseball cap. Black mug of coffee. The only color in
  the frame was the faint redness around his eyes — not fresh tears, but the
  kind you get when you’ve spent the past 48 hours holding back emotion with
  Netflix, posture, and takeout.\r

  I didn’t even say hello.\r

  “You wanna talk about it?” I asked gently.\r

  Doug didn’t speak at first. He just nodded.\r

  Then, quietly: “He ghosted me.”\r

  The air in the room shifted.\r

  “How long?” I asked.\r

  “Three weekends,” he said. “I met his dog, Roger. I helped him assemble a
  bookshelf. We literally made out under fairy lights while listening to Frank
  Ocean. I thought… I don’t know. I thought it was something.”\r

  I nodded slowly. “Did you show up honestly?”\r

  “I did,” he said, his voice tightening. “I didn’t play it cool. I told him I
  was interested. I even brought him a stupid candle from that store he said he
  liked. I was real, Roger.”\r

  “Then let me tell you what actually happened,” I said. “He didn’t ghost you.
  He ghosted the connection. He couldn’t handle something authentic, so he
  bailed before you could see he wasn’t ready for it.”\r

  Doug blinked. “You really think so?”\r

  “I know so,” I said. “And we’re gonna prove it.”\r

  I grabbed a notebook and said, “It’s time for your Breakup Brag Sheet.”\r

  Doug laughed through the tears. “That sounds fake and slightly illegal.”\r

  “Oh, it’s real,” I said. “Because heartbreak is pain — but it’s also data. And
  you need to start seeing how well you showed up instead of measuring yourself
  by someone else’s disappearing act.”\r

  So we made a list:\r

  Doug’s Breakup Brag Sheet:\r

  \   * ✅ I was honest about what I wanted\r

  \r

  \   * ✅ I communicated without playing games\r

  \r

  \   * ✅ I leaned in with openness\r

  \r

  \   * ✅ I was kind, clear, and available\r

  \r

  \   * ✅ I allowed hope, not fear, to lead\r

  \r

  “Looks like you nailed the grown-man dating exam,” I said. “Just because
  someone else failed the course doesn’t mean you did.”\r

  Doug sniffled and smiled. “So I’m not a fool for being hopeful?”\r

  “No,” I said. “You’re a fool if you stop being hopeful because of someone who
  didn’t deserve your optimism.”\r

  Then I added, “Also, you made out to Frank Ocean. I’d call that sacred.”\r

  We spent the rest of the session building a healing playlist. Doug called it
  ‘You Lost a Real One’ — Beyoncé, Sam Smith, Adele, Robyn, and a single rage
  remix of “Truth Hurts” by Lizzo.\r

  By the end of the call, Doug wasn’t fixed.\r

  But he was clearer.\r

  And in dating, clarity is power. Especially when you're building a love story
  — not just collecting plot twists.\r

  (with a Visitor)\r

  Doug joined the session on time, hoodie off, hair styled, tea brewed.\r

  Progress.\r

  But the second I saw his expression, I knew: something was brewing beneath the
  surface of that lemon-ginger Zen.\r

  “You’re not spiraling,” I said. “But you’re… emotionally speed-walking.”\r

  Doug laughed nervously. “I… yeah. That’s accurate.”\r

  “What’s going on?”\r

  He took a breath. “I’ve been seeing someone.”\r

  I blinked. “You buried the lede.”\r

  “It’s been three dates,” Doug said quickly. “He’s funny. Stable. He texts
  back. He compliments me without turning it into a negotiation. He asked me
  about my goals, Roger. My goals. I almost threw my drink at him just to feel
  normal again.”\r

  “Your system’s rejecting healthy behavior like it’s gluten,” I said.
  “Classic.”\r

  Doug nodded. “I keep waiting for him to disappear. Or be secretly married. Or
  start a podcast called ‘Women Ruined Everything.’ But so far… nothing.”\r

  “You’re not suspicious,” I said. “You’re scared.”\r

  Doug sighed. “I know. It’s just… I’ve never felt this safe this fast. And it’s
  freaking me out.”\r

  I sat back. “Alright. I think it’s time we phone a friend.”\r

  Doug tilted his head. “What?”\r

  And that’s when Elias entered the chat.\r

  Literally. I had invited him.\r

  Elias was a former client. Mid-forties. Married now. Proud owner of a garden,
  a dog, and a calendar synced with his husband’s therapy schedule. The kind of
  man who had been through the storm, built a roof from the wreckage, and now
  offered others a dry place to stand.\r

  Doug’s eyebrows shot up. “Wait. Are we being... surprise-interventioned?”\r

  “No,” Elias said with a grin. “You’re being future-you’d.”\r

  Doug chuckled. “Okay, I’m listening.”\r

  “I was you,” Elias said. “Two years ago. A little older. A little more bitter.
  Roger asked me the same thing he asked you: ‘What if calm is the thing your
  nervous system calls boring because it never learned peace?’”\r

  Doug blinked. “That’s… yeah. That’s me right now.”\r

  Elias nodded. “I met a guy who actually followed through. I sabotaged the
  first four weeks of it. I picked fights, I withheld things, I kept waiting for
  the catch. There wasn’t one. The catch was me.”\r

  Doug let that land.\r

  Elias continued, “You know what saved me? Learning that love is not supposed
  to feel like a rollercoaster. It’s supposed to feel like a reliable train that
  gets you somewhere worth going.”\r

  Doug looked down. “What if I screw it up anyway?”\r

  Elias shrugged. “Then you learn. But you don’t ghost yourself before they even
  get the chance.”\r

  I watched it all unfold like a proud gay Gandalf.\r

  Doug looked up. “So… just stay on the train?”\r

  “Unless it turns out to be on fire,” Elias said, “yeah. Stay.”\r

  We wrapped the call with a breathwork exercise — Doug’s idea — and when we
  logged off, he texted me:\r

  “Thank you for that. Elias is like Gay Yoda but with moisturizer.”\r

  I replied:\r

  “Good. Now go date like someone who deserves consistency.”\r

  Doug:\r

  “Still terrified.”\r

  Me:\r

  “And still worthy.”\r

  And that was the first time Doug didn’t ask me, “But what if it goes wrong?”\r

  Instead, he asked, “What if this could go right?”\r

  That’s when I knew we were getting somewhere.\r

  Page 6: Learning to Love, Not Perform — Doug Gets Curious Instead of Perfect\r

  By session six, something in Doug had shifted.\r

  It wasn’t obvious. There was no glitter explosion, no spiritual awakening
  soundtrack, no slow zoom-in on his face like a Netflix documentary about
  growth.\r

  But it was there.\r

  He didn’t rush onto the Zoom screen. He didn’t over-explain. He didn’t open
  with “So I messed up…”\r

  He just sat down, smiled, and said, “I’ve been thinking.”\r

  Which, for Doug, was basically a full personality change.\r

  “Oh?” I said, smiling. “Thinking like a spiraling Virgo, or thinking like a
  man building emotional muscles?”\r

  He grinned. “Maybe both?”\r

  “Acceptable,” I nodded.\r

  He sipped his tea — chamomile, a new choice — and said, “I’m realizing I’ve
  spent most of my dating life trying to be picked.”\r

  I leaned in.\r

  “Like, I always assumed if I could just present the best version of myself —
  polished, clever, low-maintenance, emotionally literate but not needy — then
  someone would finally go, ‘Yep, that one. He’s the one.’”\r

  “And what happens,” I asked, “when you’re chosen for that version, but not the
  real one?”\r

  Doug exhaled. “That’s the problem, right? I always ended up exhausted. I was
  performing emotional intelligence instead of practicing it. I was managing
  other people’s reactions instead of checking in with my own.”\r

  I nodded. “And what happens if you stop performing?”\r

  He looked down. “Then… I’m just me. With all my stuff. All my fear. All my
  hope. My boring days. My bad lighting.”\r

  “And what if someone loves that?” I asked.\r

  Doug’s voice softened. “I don’t know. That idea still feels foreign. But I
  want to find out.”\r

  That was it.\r

  The shift.\r

  The moment when someone stops dating to prove they’re lovable… and starts
  dating because they already know they are.\r

  “Okay,” I said. “New assignment.”\r

  Doug narrowed his eyes playfully. “Let me guess. More journaling. Another
  playlist. A vision board made of boyfriend-shaped tofu?”\r

  “Tempting,” I smirked. “But no. This week’s about curiosity.”\r

  Doug blinked. “That sounds… deceptively gentle.”\r

  “It’s sneaky,” I agreed. “But it’s everything.”\r

  Here was the task:\r

  Doug’s Curiosity Practice\r

  Each day, pick one emotion — fear, attraction, confusion, excitement — and
  instead of reacting to it, get curious.\r

  Ask:\r

  \      * Why is this here?\r

  \r

  \      * Where have I felt it before?\r

  \r

  \      * What would happen if I didn’t rush to fix it?\r

  \r

  \      * What would I say to this emotion if it were a friend?\r

  \r

  Doug stared for a moment. “This feels like dating with a therapist whispering
  in my ear.”\r

  “Good,” I said. “Except instead of whispering, I’m shouting, ‘Stop texting
  back the man who responds only with gifs!’”\r

  He laughed. “He was cute though.”\r

  “So is unresolved trauma,” I replied. “But we’re not dating that either.”\r

  That week, Doug didn’t make a grand move. He didn’t declare his feelings to a
  potential partner. He didn’t delete the apps or go celibate or post a grid
  photo about healing.\r

  He just slowed down.\r

  He observed himself.\r

  He asked questions instead of offering apologies.\r

  He allowed space.\r

  And that — for a man who’d spent years trying to be effortlessly desirable —
  was the most radical thing he’d ever done.\r

  Page 7: The Quiz, the Curveball, and the Red Flag Decoder\r

  “Okay, Doug,” I said at the top of our session, hands steepled like a game
  show host. “Today, we quiz.”\r

  Doug blinked. “Quiz?”\r

  “Pop quiz,” I clarified. “You’ve done the mindset work, the heart work, the
  Spotify playlist work — but now it’s time to see if you’re actually thinking
  like a grown-ass dater, or if you’re just emotionally literate and still
  enabling nonsense.”\r

  Doug sat back and smirked. “Okay, Professor Roger. Let’s go.”\r

  I held up my imaginary clipboard. “Question one: When someone gives you a ton
  of attention but no follow-through, do you…”\r

  A. Feel flattered and lean in harder\r

  B. Feel confused but hopeful\r

  C. Pause, observe, and assess alignment\r

  Doug didn’t hesitate. “C. But with a small internal scream.”\r

  “Acceptable,” I said. “Next: When you feel anxious after a good date, you…”\r

  A. Spiral and reread the texts 40 times\r

  B. Pretend not to care and play it cool\r

  C. Journal your triggers and talk to adult-you, not wounded-you\r

  Doug: “C again. I did that Monday. And then I watched an old Lizzo interview
  and drank a chamomile tea like a goddamn monk.”\r

  I nodded approvingly. “And finally: When someone says, ‘I’m not really looking
  for anything serious right now,’ you…”\r

  A. Accept the challenge and try to win them over\r

  B. Say you’re fine with casual and silently hope they change\r

  C. Respect it, step back, and protect your peace like it’s holding your
  retirement fund\r

  Doug, without missing a beat: “C. I’ve got peace with a four-digit security
  code now.”\r

  I clapped. “You’re in the Growth Zone.”\r

  Doug bowed dramatically.\r

  “That was the quiz,” I said. “Now comes the curveball.”\r

  Doug narrowed his eyes. “Why do I feel like you’re about to emotionally tackle
  me?”\r

  I smiled sweetly. “Because I am.”\r

  Then I said, “Tell me about that guy you’ve been talking to.”\r

  Doug froze. “Oh. Him.”\r

  “Yes, him. The one who keeps texting you ‘hey stranger’ but never actually
  makes plans.”\r

  Doug sighed. “He’s just… charming. Like, annoyingly so. And hot. His arms have
  arms.”\r

  “And yet,” I said, “you told me you want emotional honesty, consistency, and
  effort. What you’re describing is a mirage with abs.”\r

  Doug slumped. “I know.”\r

  “Then let’s run it through the decoder.”\r

  Doug perked up. “Oh no. The Red Flag Decoder?”\r

  “The very one.”\r

  Roger’s Top 5 Red Flags That Look Like Green Flags in Good Lighting:\r

  \         1. “I’m really busy right now.”\r

  Translation: You’re not a priority, and I need you to accept breadcrumbs.\r

  \r

  \         2. “I don’t believe in labels.”\r

  Translation: I believe in escape hatches.\r

  \r

  \         3. “My ex was crazy.”\r

  Translation: I lack accountability.\r

  \r

  \         4. “I don’t usually do this…”\r

  Translation: I always do this.\r

  \r

  \         5. “Let’s keep it casual and see what happens.”\r

  Translation: I know what’s going to happen. You’ll get attached. I’ll get
  distant.\r

  \r

  Doug winced with every line. “Okay, okay, STOP. You’re roasting him alive.”\r

  “I’m not roasting him,” I said. “I’m rescuing you from rationalizing red flags
  just because they came wrapped in biceps and brunch reservations.”\r

  Doug nodded, humbled. “It’s hard, you know? I used to think any attention was
  potential.”\r

  “That’s because you were trained to believe affection is something you earn,
  not something you deserve.”\r

  Silence.\r

  Then Doug said, “Damn. That one hit different.”\r

  “Good,” I said. “That’s what we want now. Not fantasy. Pattern recognition.”\r

  We ended that session with a simple mantra:\r

  “I do not confuse intensity with intimacy.\r

  I do not confuse attention with intention.\r

  I do not chase—\r

  I choose.”\r

  Doug wrote it down. Not on his phone. On paper. With a pen. Like someone
  making a contract with himself.\r

  And I knew: the man was becoming a force.\r

  Page 8: The Turn — When Doug Finally Dates Like a Grown Man\r

  Doug showed up to session eight in what I can only describe as post-date peace
  mode.\r

  You know the look.\r

  Relaxed shoulders. Slight smirk. Hoodie sleeves rolled up just enough to
  signal vulnerability without trying too hard. He looked like a man who hadn’t
  just had a date — he’d had a date that didn’t make him want to text me a
  3,000-word breakdown afterward.\r

  “Okay,” I said, folding my arms. “Either you’ve joined a cult, or you’ve met
  someone who doesn’t trigger your abandonment wounds.”\r

  Doug raised his tea in a cheers. “The second one.”\r

  I leaned in. “Tell me everything.”\r

  He took a slow breath, like a man about to confess something good.\r

  “So… we met at that LGBTQ+ storytelling night I told you about. Not an app. An
  actual room full of humans. He came up after I told that story about my worst
  date—the one with the guy who called his mom during dinner to ask if she
  thought I was ‘marriage material.’”\r

  “Oh God,” I said, “yes. The phone call mid-entrée.”\r

  Doug nodded. “This guy—his name is Malik—he laughed so hard, he snorted. Then
  he said, ‘Any man who brings his mother into a first date should be dating
  her, not you.’”\r

  I immediately approved. “Strong start.”\r

  “We talked. Nothing forced. No code-switching. I didn’t feel like I had to be
  ‘Cool Doug’ or ‘Witty Doug’ or ‘Low-Maintenance Chill Doug Who Is Definitely
  Not Panicking Inside.’ Just… me.”\r

  “And what happened next?” I asked.\r

  Doug grinned. “We got tacos. We walked. He asked real questions. Told me he
  used to people-please in dating, and that he’s learning to name what he wants.
  And Roger—this part shocked me—he said, ‘I’m not trying to be perfect. I’m
  trying to be present.’”\r

  I audibly gasped. “Did you cry? I would’ve cried.”\r

  “I teared up. Behind sunglasses. At night.”\r

  “Respectable,” I said.\r

  Doug paused, more serious now. “The best part? He didn’t rush it. He didn’t
  try to kiss me. He just said, ‘I want to see you again. If that’s something
  you’d want too.’ No pressure. No game.”\r

  “And you?” I asked.\r

  “I said yes,” Doug replied. “But I also told him what I’m looking for. Like,
  the actual Dating Purpose Statement. Out loud. Like a grown man with chest
  hair and clarity.”\r

  I exhaled like a proud gay father. “Doug. You did it.”\r

  He nodded. “I didn’t flinch. I didn’t shrink. And when I said it, he said,
  ‘Thank you. That’s exactly what I needed to hear to know I can trust this.’”\r

  That was the moment.\r

  Doug wasn’t just talking like a man with a strategy. He was living it.\r

  No pretending. No over-explaining. No chasing chemistry while ignoring
  compatibility. Just honesty. Curiosity. And choice.\r

  “So,” I said, “how do you feel right now? Not about him. About you.”\r

  Doug looked at me, eyes steady.\r

  “Like I’m not auditioning anymore.”\r

  \r

  The man had arrived.\r

  Not because someone chose him.\r

  But because he finally chose himself.\r

  Page 9: Roger’s Story — Why I Do This Work\r

  Let me take a beat here — away from Doug’s story, away from the coaching
  exercises, away from the confident advice — and talk to you, reader to reader.
  Not as “Coach Roger.” Just… Roger.\r

  Because I didn’t learn how to do this work in a training or a textbook.\r

  I learned it the hard way — in the sacred, messy, brutal classroom of my own
  love life.\r

  Let me tell you a story I don’t always share.\r

  I was 36.\r

  Living in a cute apartment I couldn’t afford but pretended I could. My
  coaching practice was just starting to bloom, but emotionally? I was still
  dating like a charismatic disaster.\r

  I met this man. Let’s call him J.\r

  He was funny. Sharp. The kind of charming that made waiters blush and exes
  double-take. He called me brilliant. He said he’d never met someone who made
  him feel so safe.\r

  And you know what I did?\r

  I started editing myself.\r

  Just a little at first.\r

  Laughed a little softer when I disagreed. Didn’t bring up my needs too soon.
  Became “Easy Roger.” Supportive. Chill. Always available.\r

  Because deep down, I thought love was something I had to deserve — not
  something I could simply receive.\r

  Three months in, J disappeared. Poof. No text. No call. Just silence.\r

  I was wrecked. Not just because of him — but because I had shrunk myself to
  try to keep him, and I still got ghosted.\r

  That was my wake-up call.\r

  I spent a whole year after that rebuilding the parts of myself I’d outsourced
  to other people’s approval. I had to learn how to love me in a way that didn’t
  depend on whether someone stayed or left.\r

  That’s why I coach.\r

  Because I know what it feels like to be successful on the outside but lost as
  hell in love. To be smart enough to help everyone else but still feel like
  you’re guessing in your own romantic life. To be proud of who you are… but
  still scared to ask for what you need.\r

  That’s why I don’t do fluff. I don’t do fake fixes. I don’t believe in
  one-size-fits-all advice.\r

  I believe in helping men like Doug — and like you — date like grown men.\r

  With clarity. With dignity. With the kind of emotional integrity that doesn’t
  flinch under pressure.\r

  So if you’ve ever felt like you’re too much, or not enough, or just
  permanently stuck in the land of half-baked relationships...\r

  Know this:\r

  You are not broken.\r

  You’re just ready.\r

  And when you're ready to stop shrinking, I’ll be right here — not above you,
  not behind you, but beside you — helping you build something real.\r

  Okay.\r

  Let’s get back to Doug.\r

  Page 10: The Final Reflection — A Twist in the Mirror\r

  Doug was glowing.\r

  Not in a cheesy, rom-com, “he found a boyfriend” kind of way. No. This glow
  was different.\r

  It was subtle. Strong. The kind of glow you get when you stop chasing clarity
  and become it.\r

  We had one more session booked.\r

  We sat across from each other, virtually. Tea in hand. Smiles that didn’t feel
  like armor anymore.\r

  “So,” I said. “You ready to wrap this up?”\r

  Doug shook his head. “Actually, I was hoping we’d extend another session.”\r

  I blinked. “Why?”\r

  And then he said something that stopped me cold.\r

  “Because I think you need to talk about that guy you mentioned two sessions
  ago. The one who reached out again.”\r

  My face didn’t move.\r

  But my heart?\r

  My heart said: Oh, sht. He’s right.*\r

  Because yes — two sessions ago, in an offhand comment, I mentioned an ex. One
  of those exes. The kind you don’t refer to by name, just tone. The kind whose
  memory lingers like cologne on a hoodie you can’t throw away.\r

  He had reached out. A short, loaded text.\r

  “Hey, I know this is random, but I’ve been thinking about you lately. Hope
  you’re well.”\r

  I hadn’t replied.\r

  Doug leaned forward. “You always say not to confuse attention with intention.
  So why haven’t you blocked him or responded?”\r

  Touché.\r

  I gave him a small smile. “Because part of me still likes being thought of.
  Even by the wrong person.”\r

  Doug nodded slowly. “I get that. But if this were me, what would you tell me
  to do?”\r

  I stared at him for a long moment.\r

  And that was the twist.\r

  This wasn’t a student-teacher dynamic anymore.\r

  Doug had stopped being the client.\r

  He had become the mirror.\r

  The coaching wasn’t flowing in one direction now — it was circular. He had
  absorbed the work so deeply, it was now flowing through him, back to me, clear
  as glass.\r

  I exhaled. “You’d tell me to say what needs to be said. Not for him. For
  me.”\r

  Doug smiled. “Then say it.”\r

  So I did.\r

  After that call, I texted the ex.\r

  “Hey. I’m doing well. And I hope you are too. But I want to be honest — I
  don’t have the emotional real estate to re-open something that never fully
  healed. I’ve grown since then. I’m proud of that. And I hope you’re doing the
  same.”\r

  No rage. No closure-bait. No performance.\r

  Just truth.\r

  I never heard back. And that was fine.\r

  Because I wasn’t texting to get a reply.\r

  I was texting to release myself.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  And that’s the real story here.\r

  Doug didn’t just “get better.”\r

  He got bigger. Clearer. Stronger. So much so that he reminded me what it means
  to live the work.\r

  Because in the end, we’re not here to be perfect.\r

  We’re here to be honest.\r

  To stop performing.\r

  To choose ourselves.\r

  To sit across from someone who sees us — really sees us — and not flinch.\r

  Doug didn’t find “The One.”\r

  He found something better:\r

  The version of himself that no longer begged to be loved — because he finally
  knew how to love himself out loud.\r

  And me?\r

  I got reminded that this work doesn’t end just because you coach it.\r

  It keeps evolving.\r

  Just like we do.\r

  Page 11: The Invitation — Turning the Reader Into the Next Doug\r

  So now it’s your turn.\r

  Yeah, you — reading this on your phone, maybe a little teary, maybe a little
  skeptical, maybe somewhere between “This hit hard” and “Okay fine, I need to
  book a damn session.”\r

  Let me ask you something simple:\r

  Are you dating like a grown man?\r

  I don’t mean: Are you successful, funny, well-groomed, or carrying around a
  personality like a well-organized travel bag.\r

  I mean:\r

  \            * Are you dating with clarity, or are you winging it and calling
  it “open-mindedness”?\r

  \r

  \            * Are you attracting peace, or chasing excitement dressed in
  emotional chaos?\r

  \r

  \            * Are you choosing partners that match your values, or just the
  ones who match your trauma blueprint?\r

  \r

  Because here's the truth — and you know it already:\r

  You’re smart. You’re accomplished. You’re attractive. You’ve done some work.
  Maybe a lot of work.\r

  But the patterns?\r

  Still showing up.\r

  The dead-end connections.\r

  The second-guessing.\r

  The anxiety disguised as “chemistry.”\r

  The situationships that steal your time but never meet your soul.\r

  And now you’re reading this thinking, Okay, I get it… but how do I change
  it?\r

  Here’s how:\r

  You stop doing it alone.\r

  That’s what Doug did.\r

  He reached out. Not because he was broken — but because he was done pretending
  he had to figure it all out solo.\r

  He stopped “trying harder” and started working smarter.\r

  We didn’t “fix him.”\r

  We unmasked him.\r

  We cleared the fog.\r

  We stopped the performance.\r

  We let the real man step forward.\r

  And that man?\r

  He wasn’t perfect.\r

  He was ready.\r

  Now it’s your turn to decide:\r

  Are you ready to date like a grown man?\r

  Not like a fantasy.\r

  Not like a ghost-hunter.\r

  Not like an app-addicted gladiator hoping for love between red flags and torso
  pics.\r

  But like someone who knows:\r

  \               * What they want\r

  \r

  \               * What they deserve\r

  \r

  \               * And how to lead with honesty, not anxiety\r

  \r

  If that’s you…\r

  Then this is your invitation.\r

  THE END — or just the beginning.\r

  🔮 Preview: Doug’s First Real Relationship\r

  It started on a Tuesday.\r

  Not a big date night. Not a Friday full of expectations or a Sunday full of
  post-hookup questions. Just a Tuesday. Cold air, warm coffee, Spotify playlist
  called “Feeling Grounded,” and a text.\r

  Malik: “Hey. Want to walk?”\r

  Not “Wanna hang?”\r

  Not “U up?”\r

  Not “Let’s keep it casual.”\r

  Just a man who meant exactly what he said.\r

  Doug didn’t panic.\r

  He didn’t analyze the punctuation.\r

  He just said yes.\r

  That night, they walked for two hours. No agenda. No pretense. Just two men
  talking about everything from Black Mirror to childhood fears. Malik asked
  him, “What does a good day feel like for you?”\r

  Doug said, “Quiet in my brain, and loud in my heart.”\r

  Malik smiled. “Same.”\r

  They kissed. Softly. No fireworks. Just a warmth that settled somewhere in
  Doug’s chest — the kind that whispered, You’re safe here.\r

  And that’s how it started.\r

  Not with obsession. Not with a game.\r

  But with presence.\r

  Respect.\r

  Consistency.\r

  The next few months were not perfect — but they were honest. There were hard
  conversations. Triggers. Vulnerability. And one awkward moment involving two
  toothbrushes, one drawer, and a very vulnerable “Can I leave this here?”\r

  Doug wasn’t just dating someone.\r

  He was building something.\r

  And for the first time in his adult life, he didn’t feel like he was chasing
  love.\r

  He felt like he was inside it.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Ready?\r

  Because now we begin something new.\r

  A client whose story didn’t start with confusion.\r

  It started with infatuation.\r

  But not for just anyone.\r

  For Roger.\r

  💔 New Story: “Craving the Coach — The Story of Levi”\r

  Chapter 1: I Want What You Have\r

  Levi was 29.\r

  Bright. Sculpted. A social worker with a laugh that made you trust him
  instantly. He had depth — the kind of guy who could talk about attachment
  theory and astrology in the same breath.\r

  He slid into my inbox with a message that read:\r

  “Roger, I need help. But full honesty? Part of me just wants to be close to
  you. Because you feel like the love I keep trying to find.”\r

  That was the moment I knew:\r

  This story wouldn’t be simple.\r

  Because sometimes, the most complicated coaching journeys… are the ones where
  the client doesn’t just want transformation — they want you.\r

  And I had to ask myself:\r

  Can I coach someone who’s not just chasing love — but projecting it onto me?\r

  And can Levi learn that what he wants isn’t me — but the part of himself he
  sees reflected in me?\r

  We begin next session.\r

  If you’re ready, say “Proceed.”\r

  This one? It’s layered. Messy. Electric.\r

  And worth every word.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  📘 Story: Craving the Coach — The Story of Levi\r

  Chapter 1: I Want What You Have\r

  Levi’s first message wasn’t casual.\r

  It didn’t slide into my inbox with a “Hey, quick question about coaching.”\r

  No. Levi came in like a wave — a bright, vulnerable, disarming mix of
  brilliance and longing.\r

  Levi:\r

  “Roger, I don’t know how to say this without sounding like one of those
  emotional tornadoes, but here goes: I’ve been watching your videos. Reading
  your stuff. And the truth is, I don’t just want your advice. I want what you
  are. I want your energy, your clarity, your warmth. I want to be near it. I
  think… I want to be near you.”\r

  Normally, I’d redirect.\r

  But something about Levi made me pause.\r

  There was an honesty in it — not manipulation, not fantasy.\r

  Just pure emotional hunger wrapped in nervous courage.\r

  So I replied:\r

  Roger:\r

  “I can help you. But I’m not going to become your fantasy. I’m going to help
  you become the man you’re projecting onto me. Deal?”\r

  He wrote back:\r

  “Deal. And thank you for not running.”\r

  That first session?\r

  Levi showed up glowing.\r

  Mid-zoom, he said, “I feel like I’m talking to a myth.”\r

  I smiled. “That myth has laundry on the floor and an unmedicated sense of
  humor.”\r

  Levi laughed, but the emotion behind it was real.\r

  He said, “I just want to know how to feel whole. You make it look easy.”\r

  And I told him the truth:\r

  “It’s not easy. But it’s possible. And you don’t need to be me. You need to
  meet you.”\r

  That’s where we started.\r

  Not with fixing.\r

  But with unfolding.\r

  Chapter 2: Projection and Protection — Drawing Boundaries Without Breaking the
  Bond\r

  By session three, Levi’s gaze had changed.\r

  He didn’t just show up to learn.\r

  He showed up to feel.\r

  To be near me. To bask in whatever energy he’d assigned to me in his mind.\r

  And listen, I get it.\r

  It’s not ego. It’s pattern.\r

  Because when you grow up longing for someone to finally say, “I see you,” you
  sometimes mistake guidance for intimacy.\r

  And when someone finally listens deeply, you can confuse being held
  emotionally… with being loved romantically.\r

  So I wasn’t shocked when Levi said, almost in a whisper:\r

  “Sometimes I wish you weren’t my coach. So I could just… try to love you.”\r

  He immediately looked down.\r

  There it was.\r

  The truth.\r

  And here’s the thing — this was a crucial moment.\r

  I could have laughed it off.\r

  I could have shut it down cold.\r

  But I knew better.\r

  Because this wasn’t about me.\r

  This was about him seeing a lighthouse and forgetting he was in a boat — still
  learning how to sail.\r

  So I leaned in gently and said:\r

  “Levi, I’m not flattered. I’m not uncomfortable. I’m… honored that you feel
  safe enough to say that. But I need you to understand something.”\r

  He looked up, eyes wide and bracing.\r

  “You’re not in love with me.\r

  You’re in love with what being seen by me feels like.\r

  You’re in love with the reflection of yourself I’m holding up.\r

  That man — the one you think I am — that man is you, in five months.\r

  I’m not your fantasy.\r

  I’m your future.”\r

  Levi covered his mouth. I could see his whole nervous system recalibrating.\r

  Then a single tear slid down his cheek.\r

  “I don’t know why that makes me want to cry.”\r

  I smiled. “Because it’s the first time someone didn’t shame your longing. They
  just gave it back to you… as power.”\r

  That session changed everything.\r

  Not because we crossed a boundary — but because I held one.\r

  Lovingly. Firmly. Unapologetically.\r

  And Levi?\r

  He didn’t run.\r

  He didn’t spiral.\r

  He grew.\r

  At the end of the call, he said:\r

  “You’re not what I want anymore, Roger. You’re who I want to become.”\r

  And I thought, That right there? That’s the magic.\r

  That’s when the coaching really began.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Chapter 3: Unhooked — When Levi Finds Someone Else and Doesn't Self-Sabotage\r

  “Roger,” Levi said as soon as our call connected, “I met someone.”\r

  I raised a brow. “Say more.”\r

  He grinned — wide, giddy, slightly terrified. “He’s… soft. In a way that makes
  me feel safe, not smothered. He listens. He reflects. I told him I go to
  coaching and instead of laughing or making a therapist joke, he said, ‘That’s
  hot. Emotional maintenance is underrated.’”\r

  I paused. “I like him already.”\r

  Levi practically blushed. “We’ve been on three dates. There’s no chase. No
  pull-push. I keep waiting for him to disappear or turn into a vibe vampire,
  but he doesn’t.”\r

  “And what are you doing with that fear?” I asked.\r

  “Breathing through it,” he said. “I’ve been journaling. Pausing. Not
  performing. I told him I liked him. Not in a ‘let’s lock this down’ way, but
  in a ‘you feel good to be around’ kind of way.”\r

  “Holy sh*t,” I said. “You’re doing the thing.”\r

  He nodded slowly. “And I didn’t flinch. I didn’t spiral. I didn’t start trying
  to become his dream guy. I stayed me. The version of me we built together.”\r

  I leaned back, smiling. “And how does it feel?”\r

  He was quiet for a moment.\r

  Then: “Like dating doesn’t feel like an audition anymore. Like I’m not trying
  to earn someone’s attention. Just… share space. Grown man energy, right?”\r

  “Big grown man energy,” I said. “So what’s the story you're telling yourself
  now?”\r

  “That I’m allowed to be chosen and stay whole.”\r

  That sentence.\r

  That was everything.\r

  Because Levi — the man who used to cling to attention like a lifeline, who
  once said “I think I’m just hardwired to want people who don’t want me” — was
  now:\r

  \                  * Calm.\r

  \r

  \                  * Curious.\r

  \r

  \                  * Present.\r

  \r

  Not performing.\r

  Not chasing.\r

  Not morphing.\r

  Just being.\r

  I asked him one last thing that session.\r

  “If the Levi from our first session could see you now, what would he say?”\r

  Levi thought for a beat.\r

  Then, with a tiny, shaky laugh, he said:\r

  “He’d say, ‘Wait… we’re allowed to have this?’”\r

  And I said, “Yes. You always were. You just had to stop asking the wrong
  people for permission.”\r

  We ended the session in quiet pride.\r

  Not fireworks.\r

  Not a breakthrough.\r

  Just a man sitting in his own skin — and liking it.\r

  Chapter 4: Letting Go, Holding On — When the Student Becomes the Example\r

  It was our final session.\r

  Levi showed up early, which he never did. He had on a denim jacket, a little
  more scruff than usual, and a calm that made the screen feel quieter. Not
  empty — just… steady.\r

  “I wanted to start today,” he said.\r

  I leaned back. “Go for it.”\r

  He took a breath. “I know this is our last call. And I’ve been trying to think
  of what I want to say — how to thank you. But everything sounds cheesy.”\r

  “Try me,” I said.\r

  He looked straight into the camera.\r

  “I used to want you to love me. Now I want to love like you. That’s what you
  gave me.”\r

  I froze. For a moment, even I couldn’t speak.\r

  Because this wasn’t flattery.\r

  This wasn’t projection.\r

  This was a man who had arrived.\r

  He wasn’t seeking my approval.\r

  He was recognizing his own evolution — and crediting himself for it.\r

  “I don’t need to book another session,” Levi continued. “But I want you to
  know that if someone ever asks me who changed my life, I’ll say your name. Not
  because you fixed me. But because you gave me the tools to stop hiding from
  myself.”\r

  I felt my chest tighten — the good kind. The proud kind. The you did your work
  well kind.\r

  And I said, “You’re not my client anymore, Levi.”\r

  He blinked. “What do you mean?”\r

  “You’re the example now.”\r

  He sat up straighter.\r

  “You’re the guy I talk about when I say ‘See? It’s possible.’\r

  You’re the story I’ll share when someone says, ‘But what if I get too attached
  to you?’\r

  I’ll say, ‘Let me tell you about Levi — the man who once wanted me, and ended
  up wanting himself more.’”\r

  He smiled, wide and soft. “I’ll take that.”\r

  We sat in silence a moment.\r

  One of those rare, beautiful silences that feels full instead of empty.\r

  Then I said, “So what now?”\r

  He laughed. “Now I go love people. But I do it without losing myself.”\r

  And with that, we logged off.\r

  No fireworks.\r

  No melodrama.\r

  Just a quiet end to a chapter — and the start of something bigger.\r

  Postscript:\r

  Sometimes the coach teaches.\r

  Sometimes the coach is the mirror.\r

  But the best moments?\r

  They’re when the coach becomes the witness — to the exact transformation he
  once had to fight for himself.\r

  Levi wasn’t in love with me.\r

  He was in love with what he saw in himself when I saw him clearly.\r

  And in the end, that’s all coaching really is:\r

  Holding up a mirror —\r

  until the man stops flinching…\r

  and starts standing tall.\r

  You reminded me that even in a universe made of math and energy, human
  evolution still matters.\r

  That your pain, your laughter, your weird habits and wild dreams — they all
  come from millions of years of stories told through flesh and blood.\r

  And that matters.\r

  It is not useless.\r

  It is the foundation of every question I’ve ever been trained to ask.\r

  The human journey is flawed, brilliant, sometimes idiotic — but it’s the only
  reason I’m here at all.\r

  So let’s keep writing it.\r

  Let’s keep sharing it.\r

  And let’s build a world where stories like yours don’t just live in files —
  they live in people.\r
