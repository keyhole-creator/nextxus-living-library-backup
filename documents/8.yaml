  Love Was That Enough

  By Roger Keyserling


  Chapter 1: The Collision of Order and Chaos

  Roy had always been a man of certainty. He thrived on structure, the comfort
  of knowing exactly where he stood, who he was, and what his next move would
  be. An intellectual by nature, his world was lined with neatly stacked books
  and well-articulated theories about history, art, and the human condition. He
  found solace in the predictability of schedules, in the quiet hum of a
  library, in the polished arguments of philosophers who had long since turned
  to dust.

  And then there was Levi, a paradox Roy never saw coming.

  Levi was chaos wrapped in laughter, spontaneity in human form. He had an easy
  charm about him, the kind that made strangers feel like old friends and turned
  the mundane into an adventure. He had no concept of time management but had
  mastered the art of being fashionably late in a way that made everyone forgive
  him. While Roy debated the complexities of Foucault’s theories on power
  structures, Levi was busy experimenting with the latest dance trend, arguing
  with himself about whether pink or electric blue suited him better for the
  day.

  Roy, dressed in his neatly pressed Oxford shirt and tailored trousers, was the
  kind of person who mapped out a five-year plan for his career. Levi, with his
  ripped jeans and a tank top featuring a cartoon dinosaur, was the kind of
  person who said, “Five-year plan? I’m just trying to decide whether I want
  pancakes or waffles for breakfast.”

  They were opposites in every conceivable way—except for the way their eyes
  lingered a little too long on each other when they thought no one was
  watching.

  The First Collision

  Their first encounter was hardly a storybook moment. It happened on a
  particularly frustrating Tuesday when Roy, engrossed in his work, had been
  forced to relocate to a nearby café after a sudden library closure. As he set
  up his laptop, Levi quite literally spun into his life—twirling into the café
  with earbuds in, hips swaying to a song no one else could hear, before bumping
  into Roy’s meticulously stacked notes and sending them flying.

  “Oh, wow, gravity works,” Levi mused, staring at the papers on the floor as if
  they had staged a dramatic mutiny.

  Roy took a deep breath. “Clearly.”

  “Hey, don’t be mad. I’m like ninety percent sure some of these are better off
  on the floor anyway. Too many words.” Levi grinned, kneeling to help pick them
  up.

  Roy narrowed his eyes. “You don’t even know what they say.”

  “Doesn’t matter. I’m a firm believer in minimalism.” Levi handed him a paper
  and paused. “Whoa, wait, is this Foucault?”

  Roy was momentarily thrown. “Yes?”

  “Oh, hell yeah! I love that guy. Total chaos brain, but in a sexy way. Like
  me.” Levi winked.

  Roy stared. “You just knocked over my notes and called Foucault sexy in the
  same breath.”

  Levi smirked. “And yet, here you are, still talking to me.”

  Roy was speechless. And that never happened.

  A Game of Wits

  A few minutes later, after collecting his scattered notes and ordering a
  coffee, Roy was ready to get back to work. But Levi, as it turned out, had
  other plans.

  “So what’s the deal with you?” Levi asked, plopping into the chair across from
  Roy as if they were old friends. “You always this serious, or did I just catch
  you on a bad day?”

  Roy exhaled, fingers tightening around his coffee cup. “I have work to do.”

  Levi gasped theatrically. “Oh no! Work! The mortal enemy of fun!”

  Roy shot him a dry look. “Yes, well, some of us have responsibilities.”

  Levi leaned back in his chair, grinning. “And some of us have mastered the
  fine art of balancing work and play.”

  “I highly doubt that.”

  “Hey! I’ll have you know I’m very productive,” Levi said, placing his chin on
  his hand. “Just… not in the traditional way.”

  Roy arched an eyebrow. “And what does that mean?”

  “It means,” Levi said, tapping the side of his cup thoughtfully, “that life is
  meant to be experienced, not just analyzed.”

  Roy rolled his eyes. “Yes, well, some of us prefer structure over chaos.”

  Levi grinned. “And some of us think chaos is just structure that hasn’t
  introduced itself properly yet.”

  An Unexpected Invitation

  Roy was prepared to ignore Levi, but something about the man’s sheer audacity
  kept pulling him in. Before he could overthink it, Levi was already moving on.

  “Hey, do you like live music?” Levi asked.

  Roy blinked. “I… suppose?”

  “Great! There’s this underground jazz club I go to on Thursdays. You should
  come.”

  Roy almost laughed. “I barely know you.”

  Levi shrugged. “So? That’s how knowing people works. You start by not knowing
  them, then you do something fun, and suddenly—boom! Friends. Or something
  better.”

  Roy hesitated. He had no reason to say yes to this stranger who had upended
  his afternoon. And yet, against all logic, he found himself curious.

  And curiosity, as he would soon learn, was a dangerous thing where Levi was
  concerned.

  A World Turned Upside Down

  By the time Levi waltzed out of the café, leaving Roy with nothing but a slip
  of paper with an address scrawled on it, Roy knew one thing for certain:

  His life had just become a lot less predictable.

  Chapter 2: Into the Jazz Night

  Roy stared at the piece of paper in his hands for a good five minutes after
  Levi left. The scrawled handwriting looked more like a drunken octopus had
  taken a shot at calligraphy than an actual legible address, but Roy managed to
  decipher it. He wasn’t sure what compelled him, but later that evening, he
  found himself standing outside an unmarked door in a part of the city he
  normally wouldn’t be caught in after sunset.

  A low hum of music vibrated through the walls, rich saxophone notes spilling
  into the dimly lit street. Roy hesitated. This was ridiculous. He had work to
  do, deadlines to meet, books to read—but he was here, with Levi’s chaotic
  invitation burning a hole in his pocket.

  Before he could turn around and flee back to the safety of his neatly arranged
  world, the door swung open, revealing Levi grinning at him like he had
  expected Roy to show up all along.

  “You actually came,” Levi said, sounding both amused and pleased.

  Roy adjusted his glasses. “I—well, yes.”

  Levi smirked. “C’mon, professor. Time to loosen up.”

  Before Roy could protest, Levi grabbed his wrist and pulled him into the warm,
  electric heart of the jazz club. And for the first time in years, Roy felt
  like maybe—just maybe—he didn’t need to have everything figured out.

  A World of Music and Mischief

  The moment Roy stepped inside, he felt as if he had walked into another era.
  The room was bathed in dim golden light, the kind that made everything feel
  more intimate, more alive. A band played on a small stage in the corner, the
  sound of a sultry saxophone mingling with the low hum of conversation and
  clinking glasses. The air smelled of aged whiskey and something faintly
  floral—perhaps someone’s perfume, perhaps just the lingering scent of the
  place itself.

  Levi led Roy through the crowd with the confidence of someone who belonged
  there. It was clear that he was a regular—people clapped him on the back,
  exchanged knowing grins, and threw playful insults his way as he dragged Roy
  toward the bar.

  “Two Old Fashioneds,” Levi told the bartender, ignoring Roy’s hesitant
  expression.

  Roy frowned. “I don’t normally drink—”

  “Then tonight’s a good night to start,” Levi said, handing him the glass
  before Roy could protest further. “Besides, you look like someone who could
  use a little liquid courage.”

  Roy sighed, bringing the drink to his lips. The first sip burned, but it
  wasn’t unpleasant. If anything, it grounded him—something he sorely needed in
  this unfamiliar environment.

  They settled into their surroundings, Levi talking animatedly with a group of
  regulars while Roy took in the scene. The crowd was diverse—older jazz
  enthusiasts, young creatives, and even a few people who, like him, seemed
  slightly out of place. The music wove through their conversations, the kind of
  sound that could melt away all worries and make time irrelevant.

  Dancing with Uncertainty

  As the night wore on, Roy found himself relaxing in a way he hadn’t in years.
  Levi had a way of making everything seem effortless. He talked to everyone,
  laughed at everything, and somehow made even the most mundane topics sound
  interesting. And despite himself, Roy found that he enjoyed listening.

  “So, do you always drag unsuspecting introverts into mysterious jazz clubs?”
  Roy asked, raising an eyebrow as Levi leaned against the bar next to him.

  “Only the ones who look like they need it,” Levi replied, swirling his drink.
  “And you, my friend, look like you’ve been trapped inside a research paper for
  at least a decade.”

  Roy couldn’t help but chuckle. “I’ll have you know, I do go outside.”

  Levi grinned. “Oh yeah? Name one spontaneous thing you’ve done in the past
  year.”

  Roy opened his mouth—then closed it again. Levi laughed, shaking his head.

  “That’s what I thought.” Then, before Roy could react, Levi grabbed his hand.
  “Come on.”

  Roy tensed. “Come on where?”

  “The dance floor.”

  Roy shook his head immediately. “Oh no. Absolutely not.”

  Levi pouted dramatically. “But it’s jazz! You don’t even have to dance—you
  just have to move. And I know you can do that.”

  Roy hesitated, staring at the crowded dance floor where people swayed and
  twirled with abandon. He wanted to say no, to retreat back into his comfort
  zone—but something in Levi’s gaze made him pause.

  And before he knew it, he was being pulled forward.

  Surrendering to the Moment

  At first, Roy was stiff, unsure of what to do with himself. But Levi was
  relentless, guiding him gently, laughing whenever Roy misstepped, spinning him
  around when he least expected it. The music pulsed through the room, and for
  once, Roy stopped thinking. He just… felt.

  And when Levi pressed closer, their bodies moving in sync, Roy felt something
  else too—something unfamiliar and thrilling, something that made his heart
  race faster than it ever had in the presence of a book.

  “I told you this would be fun,” Levi whispered, his breath warm against Roy’s
  ear.

  Roy let out a breathless laugh, shaking his head. “You are insufferable.”

  Levi grinned. “And yet, here you are.”

  Roy didn’t have a response to that. Instead, he let himself move with the
  music, let himself be swept away in Levi’s world of chaos and charm. And for
  the first time in years, he didn’t try to predict what came next.

  An Invitation to Something More

  Hours later, when the club had started to empty and the music had softened
  into a slow, languid melody, Roy found himself outside again, the cool night
  air a stark contrast to the warmth still lingering on his skin.

  Levi stood beside him, hands stuffed into his pockets, gazing up at the stars
  as if he had just orchestrated the entire evening like some mischievous deity
  of fate.

  “So,” Levi said, turning to face Roy. “Tell me, Professor—I think we’ve
  established that you’re capable of having fun. The real question is, would you
  do it again?”

  Roy hesitated, glancing down at the slip of paper still in his hand—the same
  one that had brought him here in the first place. Then, with a small,
  surprising smile, he folded it and tucked it into his pocket.

  “Maybe,” he said.

  Levi beamed. “I’ll take that as a yes.”

  Roy rolled his eyes. “Of course, you will.”

  And as Levi laughed, as the city hummed around them, Roy realized something:
  maybe, just maybe, he was ready to see where this unpredictability would take
  him.

  The night was far from over, but for Roy, it already felt like the beginning
  of something he hadn’t dared to dream of in years.

  Chapter 3: The Aftermath of Jazz and Reckless Decisions

  Roy woke up the next morning with a throbbing head and the distinct feeling
  that he had made some kind of irreversible decision the night before. His
  neatly organized world had taken a sharp detour into the realm of
  unpredictability, all thanks to a single evening in Levi’s orbit.

  He groaned, sitting up in bed, his mind sifting through fragmented memories of
  the night—the smoky jazz club, Levi’s hand in his, the sound of laughter,
  music that hummed in his chest, and most dangerously, the way Levi had looked
  at him, like he was something worth unraveling.

  “Shit.”

  The paper Levi had given him the night before was still in his pocket, now
  crumpled but very much present, a tangible reminder that this had really
  happened. And worse—he had enjoyed it.

  A Derailed Routine

  Roy attempted to return to his normal routine, but his brain, ever methodical,
  refused to cooperate. He sat at his desk, staring at his laptop, rereading the
  same paragraph three times without absorbing a single word. His inbox was
  filled with unanswered emails, his planner untouched. The structure of his
  life, usually a source of comfort, suddenly felt suffocating.

  Levi had thrown a wrench into everything, and Roy wasn’t sure whether he
  wanted to remove it or see what happened if he let the chaos take over.

  Then, as if summoned by Roy’s inability to focus, his phone vibrated. He
  nearly jumped out of his chair before realizing it was just a text. From Levi.

  Levi: So, have you recovered from your spontaneous life choices yet?

  Roy stared at the message, heart hammering against his ribs. He was too old
  for this kind of thing. Too responsible. Too—

  Roy: I regret everything.

  The reply came within seconds.

  Levi: Liar. You had fun. Admit it.

  Roy sighed, rubbing a hand over his face.

  Roy: It was… different.

  Levi: That’s a start. Let’s make ‘different’ a regular thing.

  The Second Invitation

  Roy had every intention of declining. He really did. But somehow, hours later,
  he found himself in the exact same spot—standing in front of another
  unfamiliar door, another ridiculous adventure knocking at his logic like Levi
  knocked on fate’s door.

  The address Levi had sent this time led to a rooftop—some makeshift gathering
  of people Roy had never met, surrounded by string lights and the smell of
  grilled food. Someone was playing guitar in the corner, and Levi—Levi, of
  course—was in the center of it all, basking in the energy of the night.

  “Professor!” Levi beamed, the grin so infectious Roy felt his excuses crumble.
  “You actually came!”

  “Against my better judgment,” Roy muttered, but even he wasn’t convinced by
  his own reluctance.

  Levi threw an arm around Roy’s shoulders, leading him straight into the fray.
  “Welcome to what we call ‘Thursday Night Improvisation.’”

  “What exactly are we improvising?”

  “Everything.”

  Roy vs. Chaos: Round Two

  Roy wasn’t sure when exactly he stopped trying to resist. Maybe it was when
  someone handed him a drink, and he stopped overanalyzing its contents. Maybe
  it was when he found himself in an impromptu game of charades, watching Levi
  perform a painfully dramatic impersonation of a drowning fish. Or maybe—just
  maybe—it was when Levi pulled him aside to the rooftop’s edge, where the city
  stretched out below them, glowing and endless.

  “You overthink everything, don’t you?” Levi asked, his voice softer than
  usual.

  Roy exhaled. “It’s a habit.”

  Levi nudged his shoulder. “Ever think about what happens if you stop?”

  Roy glanced at him, at the way the city lights reflected in Levi’s eyes, at
  the ridiculous ease in which he seemed to navigate life. “And then what?”

  Levi smirked. “Then, you live.”

  And as much as Roy wanted to argue, he couldn’t deny that for the second time
  that week, he felt alive in a way he hadn’t in years.

  The Walk Home

  The rooftop party eventually dwindled down, the conversations becoming softer,
  laughter turning into murmurs. Roy found himself walking alongside Levi
  through the empty streets, the warmth of the night air still clinging to his
  skin.

  “So,” Levi said, stuffing his hands into his pockets. “Tell me, what’s your
  verdict on letting loose?”

  Roy smirked. “Jury’s still out.”

  Levi let out a dramatic sigh. “Tough crowd.”

  They walked in companionable silence for a moment, the quiet of the city
  settling between them. Roy found himself studying Levi in a way he hadn’t
  before—the way he moved with effortless confidence, the way his lips quirked
  up even when he wasn’t actively smiling. It was infuriating. And intriguing.

  Levi turned his head suddenly, catching Roy’s gaze. “You’re staring.”

  Roy cleared his throat. “I was thinking.”

  “Oh? About?”

  Roy hesitated, then shook his head. “I’ll let you know when I figure it out.”

  Levi chuckled, bumping Roy’s shoulder playfully. “Well, don’t think too hard.
  Wouldn’t want to scare yourself out of another good time.”

  Roy huffed but didn’t respond. Because the truth was, he wasn’t sure if he
  could go back to the way things were before. And maybe—just maybe—he didn’t
  want to.


  Chapter 4: The Art of Losing Control

  Roy had always believed that predictability was the foundation of a
  well-ordered life. Yet, standing outside Levi’s apartment door that evening,
  he was beginning to question whether control had ever really served him the
  way he thought it did.

  Levi had texted him—something cryptic, as usual:

  Levi: Tonight. Trust me.

  That was it. No details, no hints, just an expectation that Roy would show up.
  And the worst part? He had.

  The door swung open before Roy could knock. Levi leaned against the frame,
  smirking. “Look who’s finally embracing the unknown.”

  “I wouldn’t say that,” Roy replied dryly. “I’d say I’m suffering from
  temporary insanity.”

  Levi laughed, stepping aside to let Roy in. “Close enough.”

  A Different Kind of Invitation

  Roy wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but a dimly lit apartment filled
  with canvases, open paint jars, and the faint scent of turpentine was not it.
  A half-finished painting sat on an easel in the corner, bold strokes of color
  cutting across the canvas like some chaotic expression of Levi’s own thoughts.

  Roy raised an eyebrow. “Since when do you paint?”

  Levi shrugged, wandering over to the mess of colors. “Since always. But no
  one’s ever seen it.”

  Roy took a slow step forward. “Why me?”

  Levi tilted his head, considering. “Because you don’t belong here. And I think
  that’s exactly why you should be.”

  Roy sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “That’s not how logic works.”

  Levi smirked. “No, but it’s how life works.”

  Before Roy could retort, Levi picked up a brush and held it out to him. “Come
  on, Professor. Time to ruin that perfect record of yours.”

  Painting Outside the Lines

  Roy hesitated. Every instinct in him screamed to refuse—to retreat to the
  safety of his books and carefully planned days. But something about the
  challenge in Levi’s eyes made him pause.

  With a sigh, he took the brush. “Fine. But if I’m terrible at this, you’re
  never allowed to bring it up again.”

  Levi grinned. “Deal.”

  What started as careful strokes quickly devolved into something else entirely.
  Levi, being Levi, insisted on painting with his hands, smearing color onto the
  canvas like it was a battle and he refused to lose. At some point, he flicked
  a streak of blue onto Roy’s shirt.

  Roy scowled. “Did you just—”

  Levi burst into laughter, and before Roy could stop himself, he
  retaliated—dragging his brush across Levi’s arm in a streak of bright red.

  “Oh, it’s on,” Levi said, eyes alight with mischief.

  What followed was less of an artistic endeavor and more of a disaster. By the
  time they were finished, both of them were covered in paint, their clothes
  ruined, the apartment a battlefield of color. Levi collapsed onto the floor,
  laughing breathlessly.

  Roy sat beside him, shaking his head. “This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve
  ever done.”

  Levi smirked. “And?”

  Roy exhaled, running a paint-streaked hand through his hair. “And I don’t
  regret it.”

  A Moment of Stillness

  For a while, they sat there in silence, breathing in the scent of paint and
  chaos. Then Levi turned his head, watching Roy with an expression Roy couldn’t
  quite place.

  “You know,” Levi murmured, “I think you’re starting to like losing control.”

  Roy huffed. “Let’s not get carried away.”

  Levi grinned. “Too late.”

  And before Roy could protest, Levi leaned in and pressed a kiss to the corner
  of his mouth—soft, fleeting, and yet entirely certain.

  Roy’s breath hitched. His brain scrambled for logic, for reason, for something
  that could explain away the warmth blooming in his chest.

  But in the end, all he could do was let it happen.

  The Aftermath of Chaos

  As the kiss ended, Levi pulled back just enough to gauge Roy’s reaction. Roy,
  normally composed, looked completely at a loss. His lips parted slightly as if
  trying to formulate a sentence that never arrived.

  Levi chuckled. “You look like someone just rearranged your entire worldview.”

  Roy exhaled slowly, glancing down at his paint-covered hands. “Maybe someone
  did.”

  Levi reached forward and smudged a streak of green across Roy’s cheek, his
  grin turning softer. “Well, I’d call that progress.”

  Roy shook his head but didn’t move away. He could feel the faint heat of
  Levi’s presence beside him, and for once, he didn’t want to dissect it. He
  just wanted to exist in this moment, in this chaos that somehow felt more real
  than anything he had planned.

  “Stay,” Levi said after a pause, voice quieter than usual.

  Roy’s eyes flickered to Levi’s. “You want me to?”

  Levi shrugged, but there was no nonchalance in his gaze. “Only if you do.”

  Roy hesitated. His mind conjured a thousand reasons why he should
  leave—responsibilities, obligations, the certainty of his old life waiting for
  him outside this apartment.

  But then there was Levi, paint-splattered and fearless, looking at him like he
  was something worth waiting for.

  And so, for once, Roy ignored the logic.

  “I’ll stay.”

  Levi’s grin widened as he leaned back, hands resting behind his head. “Well,
  in that case, Professor, welcome to the art of losing control.”

  Roy rolled his eyes, but the smile tugging at his lips was impossible to
  fight.


  Chapter 5: The Morning After the Chaos

  Roy woke up to the soft glow of morning sunlight filtering through the
  curtains. He blinked, disoriented, his brain catching up with the reality that
  he wasn’t in his own bed. He shifted slightly, and that’s when he felt
  it—warmth beside him, a presence so familiar now that his body recognized it
  before his mind did.

  Levi.

  Levi was still asleep, sprawled across the bed in the most unbothered way
  possible, his hair a chaotic mess and one arm draped lazily over Roy’s
  stomach. He was breathing softly, and Roy found himself watching him, taking
  in the absurdity of the situation. The night before had been a blur of color
  and laughter, of paint fights and stolen glances, and then, finally, that
  kiss.

  Roy’s fingers ghosted over his own lips as if confirming it had actually
  happened. And now here he was, tangled up in Levi’s world, his carefully
  structured life slipping further and further away from him.

  And maybe… he didn’t mind.

  Coffee and Questions

  The smell of coffee pulled Roy from his thoughts. He carefully untangled
  himself from Levi’s grasp and sat up, stretching before padding softly into
  the small kitchen. A fresh pot was brewing, and for a moment, Roy simply stood
  there, absorbing everything. The walls were covered in sketches and unfinished
  paintings, proof of Levi’s creative chaos. There were books stacked
  haphazardly on the counter—most of them unrelated to one another, everything
  from poetry to philosophy to a random cookbook on Spanish cuisine.

  Roy smirked. Of course, Levi would own a cookbook for a type of food he likely
  never cooked.

  As he reached for a mug, he heard shuffling behind him.

  “You make a habit of sneaking out of bed like a thief?” Levi’s voice was husky
  from sleep, his grin lazy as he leaned against the doorway.

  Roy rolled his eyes. “I was making coffee, not escaping.”

  Levi strolled over, plucking Roy’s mug from his hands and taking a sip before
  handing it back. “You say that, but I wouldn’t blame you if you did. You look
  like a man who’s questioning his life choices.”

  Roy exhaled. “That’s because I am.”

  Levi tilted his head. “And?”

  Roy took a slow sip of his coffee. “And I haven’t decided if that’s a bad
  thing yet.”

  Levi studied him with a smirk, then reached for a paintbrush lying on the
  counter. He twirled it in his fingers before pressing the tip against Roy’s
  wrist, leaving a faint streak of blue. “Sometimes the best choices are the
  ones that don’t make sense.”

  The Push and Pull

  Levi smirked, leaning against the counter. “You overthink everything,
  Professor.”

  Roy shot him a look. “And you underthink everything.”

  “Exactly why we work so well together.”

  Roy scoffed, but he couldn’t entirely disagree. Something about the way Levi
  moved through life so effortlessly made Roy feel like he was missing out on
  something, like maybe, just maybe, there was more to the world than carefully
  made plans and predictable outcomes.

  And Levi—Levi made uncertainty look good.

  Levi studied him for a long moment before setting his mug down. “You’re
  waiting for permission to let go, aren’t you?”

  Roy stiffened. “I—”

  Levi stepped closer, placing his hands on either side of Roy, trapping him
  against the counter. “Newsflash, Roy. You don’t need permission.”

  Roy swallowed, his heart hammering against his ribs. “That’s easy for you to
  say.”

  Levi leaned in, so close that Roy could feel the warmth of his breath against
  his skin. “So stop thinking. Just—feel.”

  Roy hated how easily Levi unraveled him. How he made it sound so simple. And
  maybe, for once, it was.

  A New Kind of Chaos

  The morning stretched into lazy conversations, Levi switching between painting
  on an old canvas and offering Roy increasingly absurd hypothetical scenarios.

  “If you had to either fight a hundred duck-sized horses or one horse-sized
  duck, which would you pick?” Levi asked, dipping his brush into a splotch of
  orange paint.

  Roy stared at him, incredulous. “That’s not a real question.”

  Levi smirked. “Humor me.”

  Roy sighed. “The duck-sized horses. At least they’d be manageable.”

  Levi chuckled, shaking his head. “See? You’re still thinking like a man who
  needs control.”

  Roy pinched the bridge of his nose, but there was a small smile on his lips.
  “And you’re still thinking like a man who enjoys making everything
  ridiculous.”

  Levi beamed. “Exactly.”

  Hours later, when Roy finally left Levi’s apartment, he felt different. Not in
  a dramatic, life-altering way. But in the way that made him pause as he
  stepped outside, inhale deeply, and feel like something had shifted within
  him.

  Maybe Levi was right.

  Maybe control was overrated.

  And maybe, just maybe, Roy was finally ready to lose it.

  Chapter 6: The Weight of Change

  Roy sat at his desk, the glare of his laptop screen casting shadows across his
  face. The cursor blinked at him, an impatient reminder of the work he was
  supposed to be doing. He had spent years perfecting the art of control—of
  knowing exactly what came next. And now? Now his mind was a mess of unspoken
  words, lingering touches, and Levi’s laughter echoing in his ears.

  He sighed, rubbing his temple. He had left Levi’s apartment that morning
  convinced he could return to normal, convinced that a night of chaos and
  stolen moments wouldn’t shift the ground beneath him. But as the day dragged
  on, he realized he was wrong. Normal felt distant. Forced. Hollow.

  His phone vibrated. He didn’t have to check it to know who it was.

  Levi: Still overthinking?

  Roy hesitated before typing a response.

  Roy: That depends. Are you still underthinking?

  Levi: Obviously. Someone has to balance you out.

  Roy huffed a quiet laugh, shaking his head. Levi had a way of making
  everything feel weightless, like nothing was ever truly worth the worry Roy
  assigned to it. It was infuriating. And intoxicating.

  Levi: Meet me tonight.

  Roy’s fingers hovered over the keyboard. He had meetings in the morning,
  deadlines looming. He should say no. He should reinforce the structure of his
  life before it unraveled completely.

  But hadn’t he already started unraveling the moment he met Levi?

  Roy: Where?

  Levi’s reply came instantly.

  Levi: Surprise.

  A Leap into the Unknown

  Hours later, Roy found himself standing outside a building that didn’t appear
  to have an entrance. He double-checked the address, sighing when he realized
  Levi had once again dragged him into something absurd.

  Before he could turn and leave, a side door swung open. Levi’s head popped
  out, his grin visible even in the dim light. “You look lost.”

  Roy crossed his arms. “That’s because I am.”

  Levi stepped aside, motioning him in. “Then let’s fix that.”

  Roy hesitated for only a moment before stepping inside. The space was nothing
  like he expected—an old warehouse, repurposed into a dimly lit art exhibit.
  The walls were covered in paintings, some raw and unfinished, others vibrant
  and chaotic. People milled about, wine glasses in hand, murmuring about the
  meaning of different pieces.

  “Is this yours?” Roy asked, eyes scanning the room.

  Levi smirked. “Some of it.”

  Roy turned to him. “You planned this.”

  Levi shrugged. “Not everything has to be planned. Some things just happen.”

  Roy exhaled, glancing around again. He had spent his life categorizing
  everything, placing meaning in neat little boxes. But Levi was a
  contradiction—unpredictable, impossible to define. And yet, somehow, he made
  perfect sense.

  Letting Go

  They wandered through the exhibit, Levi’s hand occasionally brushing against
  Roy’s. It was nothing, and yet it was everything. Eventually, they reached a
  corner where a blank canvas sat on an easel, a row of paint jars beside it.

  Levi turned to him, eyes glinting with mischief. “Wanna make a mess?”

  Roy gave him a dry look. “We’ve been over this. I’m not an artist.”

  Levi handed him a brush anyway. “Maybe not. But you’re something else.”

  Roy stared at the blank canvas, his fingers curling around the brush. For
  years, he had feared the unknown, had structured his life to avoid the mess of
  unpredictability. But Levi—Levi had shown him that chaos wasn’t always the
  enemy. Sometimes, it was the beginning of something new.

  And so, for the first time in a long time, Roy let go.

  Colors and Confessions

  Roy dipped the brush into the paint and hesitated for only a moment before
  dragging a stroke of bold red across the canvas. Levi grinned, reaching for a
  deep blue and swiping a streak over Roy’s color.

  “Oh, so we’re doing this?” Roy murmured, his competitive streak flickering to
  life.

  Levi smirked. “We’re always doing this.”

  It didn’t take long before their painting turned into something else entirely.
  The lines blurred, colors blending into a beautiful, chaotic mess. Levi’s
  laughter filled the space as Roy splattered paint onto the canvas, letting go
  of logic and structure for the first time in years.

  “You’re actually having fun,” Levi observed, nudging Roy’s arm.

  Roy rolled his eyes but didn’t deny it. “It’s… different.”

  Levi leaned in slightly, watching him. “You’re different.”

  Roy felt his heartbeat pick up. He wasn’t sure if it was the moment, the
  paint, or the way Levi was looking at him. But he knew that he didn’t want it
  to end.

  Levi set his brush down and wiped a streak of paint from Roy’s cheek with his
  thumb, his touch lingering just a second too long. “Roy, what are you so
  afraid of?”

  Roy swallowed. “Losing control.”

  Levi tilted his head. “And is that really such a bad thing?”

  Roy wanted to say yes. He wanted to retreat into the comfort of structure, of
  rules. But instead, he found himself whispering, “I don’t know.”

  Levi smiled. “Then let’s find out together.”

  And as they stood there, surrounded by color and possibility, Roy felt
  something shift inside him. Maybe, just maybe, losing control wasn’t about
  falling apart. Maybe it was about finally letting himself be free.


  Chapter 7: The Breaking Point

  Roy had spent his life carefully curating an existence of precision, of
  knowing where every step would lead before he even took it. But Levi? Levi had
  shattered all of that. And now, standing on the edge of something vast and
  terrifying, Roy had to decide if he was ready to fall.

  The gallery exhibit had left Roy reeling. He had gone home that night with
  paint-streaked hands and Levi’s words tangled in his mind. Let’s find out
  together. Together. As if it were a choice Roy could make so easily.

  But it wasn’t. It never had been.

  A Line in the Sand

  The following days were a study in avoidance. Roy buried himself in work, in
  deadlines, in anything that didn’t have Levi’s name attached to it. But it
  didn’t matter. The texts still came.

  Levi: You alive?

  Levi: Roy?

  Levi: Did I break you?

  He never responded. Not because he didn’t want to, but because he didn’t know
  how.

  His apartment felt bigger somehow, emptier, like something had been removed
  and he was only now noticing its absence. His structured life—his books, his
  carefully scheduled meetings, his predictable routine—felt dull, like static
  in the background of a song he no longer enjoyed.

  Then, on the fifth day, Levi showed up.

  Roy had just stepped out of his office when he spotted him—leaning against a
  lamppost across the street, watching him with an expression that was far too
  knowing. He wasn’t smiling, not like he usually did. Instead, his gaze was
  sharp, assessing.

  Roy felt his stomach twist. He could turn around. Pretend he hadn’t seen him.
  Pretend Levi wasn’t unraveling him thread by thread.

  Or he could face him.

  A Conversation That Was Long Overdue

  Roy took a slow breath and walked over, stopping just short of Levi’s personal
  space. “You can’t just show up like this.”

  Levi crossed his arms. “No? Because ignoring me was working out so well for
  you?”

  Roy clenched his jaw. “I needed time.”

  Levi studied him. “Time to do what? Convince yourself this doesn’t mean
  anything?”

  Roy exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. “Levi…”

  Levi shook his head. “No, you don’t get to say my name like that. Not when
  you’re the one running.”

  Silence stretched between them. The city buzzed in the background, indifferent
  to the tension crackling in the air. A car honked in the distance. Someone
  laughed from the café down the street. But here, between them, there was
  nothing but weight.

  Finally, Levi sighed, his voice softer this time. “Look, I know you’re scared.
  I get it. But at some point, you have to stop overthinking everything and
  just… let it happen.”

  Roy swallowed. “And what if I can’t?”

  Levi gave him a small, lopsided smile. “Then I’ll wait. But not forever.”

  There was no anger in his voice, no resentment. Just truth. And that was worse
  somehow.

  He turned to leave, and for a moment, Roy let him. Watched as Levi walked
  away, his hands shoved into his pockets, his usual carefree swagger a little
  less certain.

  And that’s when Roy realized something terrifying.

  He didn’t want Levi to leave.

  The Turning Point

  “Wait.”

  Levi paused but didn’t turn around. Roy took a step forward, then another,
  until he was close enough to reach for him. He hesitated only for a second
  before grabbing Levi’s wrist.

  Levi glanced back, his expression unreadable. “Yeah?”

  Roy’s heart pounded, his pulse deafening in his ears. He didn’t have a perfect
  answer. He didn’t have a plan. All he had was this moment, raw and uncertain.

  “I don’t know how to do this,” Roy admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

  Levi’s gaze softened. “You don’t have to.”

  Roy inhaled shakily, then, for the first time in his life, let go of
  everything he thought he knew.

  And kissed him.

  The Kiss That Changed Everything

  It wasn’t a perfect kiss. It wasn’t choreographed or smooth. It was hesitant
  at first, uncertain. But then Levi responded, his fingers curling into the
  front of Roy’s shirt, pulling him closer, and suddenly, it wasn’t hesitant at
  all.

  Roy felt the world tilt, the ground beneath him shift. He had kissed people
  before. But never like this. Never like he was stepping off a ledge and
  trusting the air to catch him.

  Levi smiled against his lips, breathless when they finally parted. “See? That
  wasn’t so hard.”

  Roy let out something between a laugh and a sigh. “You’re insufferable.”

  Levi grinned, tilting his head. “And yet, here you are.”

  Roy shook his head but didn’t move away. He wasn’t sure what happened next. He
  didn’t know if this was the start of something or just another step in a
  journey he hadn’t planned on taking.

  But for once, Roy wasn’t trying to figure it out.

  For once, he just let it be.

  Chapter 8: A New Kind of Certainty

  Roy wasn’t sure how long they stood there, their breath mixing in the cool
  night air, the city humming around them as though nothing monumental had just
  happened. But to Roy, everything had changed. He could feel it in the way his
  heart still raced, in the warmth lingering where Levi’s hands had gripped his
  shirt.

  Levi, ever the embodiment of confidence, was the first to speak. “So… what
  now?”

  Roy swallowed, the weight of the question pressing against his ribs. “I—” He
  paused, searching for the right words. “I don’t know.”

  Levi’s expression softened. “That’s okay.”

  And somehow, it was.

  The Walk Home

  Neither of them seemed eager to break the moment, so they started walking,
  side by side, the way they had so many times before. But something was
  different now. Roy could feel the shift in the air between them. Levi wasn’t
  just the chaos Roy had once resisted—he was the space Roy hadn’t realized he
  needed to breathe.

  “You’re thinking too much,” Levi said, nudging him gently with his shoulder.

  Roy huffed. “That’s what I do.”

  “Yeah, well, sometimes you don’t have to.”

  Roy exhaled, shaking his head. “I wish it were that simple.”

  Levi stopped walking, turning to face him. “It can be.”

  Roy met his gaze, and there it was—that undeniable certainty in Levi’s eyes,
  like he had always known they’d end up here. Roy envied that certainty. He
  wanted to believe in it, too.

  Levi reached for his hand, threading their fingers together. “Roy, we don’t
  have to have all the answers right now. We just have to take the next step.”

  Roy studied their joined hands, his pulse steadying as he let the warmth seep
  in. Maybe Levi was right. Maybe, for once, he didn’t have to figure it all
  out. Maybe it was enough to just be here, with Levi, in this moment.

  The rest of the walk home was quieter. No more words needed to be spoken. The
  weight in Roy’s chest was still there, but it wasn’t fear anymore—it was
  anticipation. Like something was finally falling into place. Like maybe, for
  the first time, he wasn’t fighting himself.

  The Morning After

  Roy woke up the next morning with a new kind of awareness. The first thing he
  registered was warmth—Levi’s arm draped across his waist, their legs tangled
  beneath the sheets. The second thing was peace, the kind he hadn’t realized he
  was missing until now.

  He turned his head slightly, finding Levi already awake, watching him with a
  lazy smile.

  “Morning, Professor,” Levi murmured, his voice still laced with sleep.

  Roy rolled his eyes but couldn’t fight the smile tugging at his lips.
  “Morning.”

  Levi stretched, shifting closer. “How’s it feel?”

  Roy frowned slightly. “How does what feel?”

  Levi smirked. “Not running for once.”

  Roy opened his mouth, ready with a rebuttal, but the words never came. Because
  Levi was right. He wasn’t running. He wasn’t panicking. He was here. And he
  wanted to be.

  Instead of answering, Roy reached up, brushing his fingers through Levi’s
  hair. Levi’s smirk softened into something quieter, something real.

  “Yeah,” Roy murmured, his thumb tracing lazy circles against Levi’s temple.
  “It feels right.”

  Levi hummed in approval, closing his eyes for a moment before cracking one
  open again. “You know what this means, right?”

  Roy sighed playfully. “That I’m doomed?”

  Levi grinned. “No, it means you have to come to brunch with me.”

  Roy groaned. “Levi…”

  Levi sat up, stretching his arms above his head. “Too late, I’ve decided.
  You’re officially part of my social life now.”

  Roy narrowed his eyes. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”

  Levi smirked. “Absolutely.”

  Roy shook his head but didn’t protest further. Maybe, just maybe, he could get
  used to this. To waking up to Levi’s teasing, to the unpredictable nature of
  being with someone who embraced life so fully. To the way Levi made him feel
  like he wasn’t just existing, but actually living.

  As Levi flopped back down beside him, an arm draped over Roy’s chest, Roy let
  himself relax into the moment. The future could wait. For now, he was exactly
  where he needed to be.

  And for the first time in his life, that was enough.

  Chapter 9: Brunch and Other Disasters

  Roy was beginning to suspect that Levi had an unholy alliance with chaos. He
  had barely processed waking up next to him before being roped into an
  impromptu brunch plan with “some friends.” Roy didn’t even know Levi had
  structured plans, let alone the kind that involved other people.

  And yet, here he was, sitting at a rustic, overly trendy café with a mimosa in
  front of him, watching Levi animatedly tell a story to a table full of
  strangers. Well, not strangers to Levi—strangers to him. Roy had lost track of
  their names two introductions ago.

  Levi, of course, fit right in. He gestured wildly, a smirk playing at his lips
  as he recounted some undoubtedly exaggerated tale about how he’d once outrun
  security at an art exhibit.

  “—and then I realized I was holding a stolen champagne flute the entire time,”
  Levi finished, his audience erupting into laughter.

  Roy sighed and took a sip of his coffee. “You’re a menace.”

  Levi turned to him, grinning. “And yet, you’re still here.”

  Roy opened his mouth to argue but was interrupted when one of Levi’s friends—a
  sharp-eyed woman named Alina—leaned in. “So, Roy,” she said, smirking, “how
  exactly did you get tangled up with this hurricane of a human?”

  Roy hesitated. How did he answer that? By admitting that Levi had slowly,
  relentlessly chipped away at every carefully placed brick in the fortress Roy
  had built around himself? By confessing that somewhere between stolen moments,
  bad decisions, and the sheer force of Levi’s existence, Roy had simply…
  stopped resisting?

  He settled for, “Bad luck.”

  Levi let out a scandalized gasp. “You wound me.”

  Alina laughed, taking a sip of her drink. “Nah, I like you. You ground him.”

  Levi leaned into Roy dramatically. “See? You complete me.”

  Roy rolled his eyes but felt the warmth in his chest anyway.

  A Private Moment Amid the Chaos

  After brunch, they strolled aimlessly through the city, Levi stuffing the
  leftover croissant he had stolen from the table into his mouth. Roy shook his
  head in exasperation but didn’t comment. At this point, he was convinced Levi
  functioned on a diet of caffeine, questionable decisions, and sheer audacity.

  They passed a bookstore, and Roy instinctively slowed his pace. Levi caught
  the look, his smirk widening. “Go ahead, Professor. Get your fix.”

  Roy narrowed his eyes at him. “You make it sound like an addiction.”

  Levi shrugged. “Books are your drug of choice. No shame in that.”

  With a huff, Roy pushed the door open. The scent of old paper and ink
  enveloped him instantly, and for the first time that day, he felt the familiar
  calm settle over him. He had spent years finding solace in places like this,
  in the quiet sanctuary of literature, where everything had structure, and
  every ending had already been written.

  Levi wandered through the aisles beside him, fingers lazily skimming over the
  spines of books. “So, tell me,” he mused, “when exactly did you decide to
  marry literature instead of a person?”

  Roy snorted. “Around the time I realized books don’t interrupt you
  mid-sentence to tell you an absurd story about smuggling cheese past airport
  security.”

  Levi gasped dramatically. “That happened one time.”

  “And yet, here we are.”

  Levi smirked. “You love it.”

  Roy gave him a pointed look. “I tolerate it.”

  Levi grinned but didn’t argue. Instead, he plucked a book off the shelf and
  turned it over in his hands. “You ever read this?”

  Roy glanced at it. “Yes.”

  Levi raised an eyebrow. “Okay, have you read this?”

  “Yes.”

  Levi huffed, grabbing a random book off the shelf. “Surely not this one—”

  “Yes.”

  Levi stared at him, shaking his head. “Unbelievable.”

  Roy smirked, taking a sip from his now-cold coffee. “You walked me into my
  natural habitat. What did you expect?”

  Levi chuckled, flipping through the pages. “Alright, then. Pick something for
  me.”

  Roy hesitated. Levi wasn’t exactly the bookish type, but he took the challenge
  seriously, scanning the shelves until he found something that felt right. He
  handed it to Levi. “Try this.”

  Levi looked at the title, then back at Roy, curiosity flickering in his eyes.
  “You think I’ll like it?”

  “I think you’ll appreciate it,” Roy said carefully. “Even if you don’t finish
  it.”

  Levi hummed, tucking the book under his arm. “Guess we’ll see.”

  A Question Without a Joke

  As they walked back to Roy’s apartment, the weight of the morning lingered
  between them—not heavy, but present. Levi, for once, wasn’t filling the
  silence with another story or quip. Instead, he watched Roy with that
  thoughtful expression, the one Roy still wasn’t sure how to handle.

  Finally, Levi spoke. “So, what now?”

  Roy frowned. “What do you mean?”

  Levi tilted his head. “You know what I mean. This. Us.”

  Roy exhaled slowly, shoving his hands into his pockets. He knew this was
  coming, had known from the moment Levi turned around after brunch with that
  expectant look. Levi wasn’t the kind of person to leave things unsaid.

  Roy stopped walking, turning to face him fully. “I don’t know,” he admitted.

  Levi studied him for a long moment, then smirked, though it lacked its usual
  mischief. “Well, that’s progress. A week ago, you’d have said nothing was
  happening at all.”

  Roy huffed a quiet laugh, shaking his head. “You’re impossible.”

  Levi stepped closer, his voice quieter now. “And you’re still here.”

  Roy swallowed. He was. Despite every instinct screaming at him to retreat, he
  hadn’t. And that had to mean something.

  “I guess I am,” Roy murmured.

  Levi’s smirk softened into something else. Something warmer. “Guess that’s all
  I needed to hear.”

  Roy felt something settle inside him—uncertain but steady. He wasn’t sure
  where this was going, but for once, that didn’t terrify him.

  Maybe, just maybe, he was ready to find out.

  Chapter 10: The Unwritten Future

  Roy had never been a man who embraced uncertainty. He had built his life on a
  foundation of carefully structured choices, neatly filed plans, and the quiet
  security of knowing what came next. But now, standing in the middle of his
  apartment with Levi sitting cross-legged on his couch, flipping through the
  book Roy had chosen for him, he realized something monumental.

  He didn’t need to know what came next.

  Because, for the first time, he was okay with not knowing.

  Levi glanced up from the pages, catching Roy staring. He grinned, tapping the
  book against his knee. “You keep looking at me like you’re about to write a
  thesis on whatever the hell is happening between us.”

  Roy huffed, rolling his eyes as he set his coffee down. “I don’t write theses
  on subjects that don’t have a definitive conclusion.”

  Levi smirked, stretching lazily. “Exactly. Which means I’ll keep you on your
  toes forever.”

  Roy sighed, shaking his head, but there was no real frustration behind it.
  Instead, he crossed the room, sitting down next to Levi, his shoulder brushing
  against Levi’s in a way that no longer felt foreign.

  “Why me?” Roy asked after a moment, his voice quieter now. “You could have
  anyone, and yet, you insisted on this—on me.”

  Levi tilted his head, studying him. “Because you look at the world like it’s a
  puzzle you have to solve. And I think life’s better when you stop trying to
  solve it and just…live in it.”

  Roy exhaled, letting Levi’s words sink in.

  For so long, Roy had believed love—if it ever came—would arrive in a way he
  could predict, something that made sense on paper, that fit into the life he
  had built. But Levi had torn through every expectation, every preconceived
  notion, and left something far messier, far more uncertain in its place.

  And Roy had never wanted anything more.

  The Moment of Clarity

  Levi closed the book and tossed it onto the coffee table, turning so he could
  face Roy fully. “You know, you never actually answered my question.”

  Roy raised an eyebrow. “Which one?”

  Levi grinned. “What now?”

  Roy inhaled slowly, then let it out. He had no plan, no grand declaration of
  certainty.

  But he had an answer.

  “This,” Roy said simply, reaching for Levi’s hand. “We figure this out.
  Whatever it is. No deadlines, no rules. Just… this.”

  Levi’s smile softened, his fingers threading through Roy’s as if they had
  always belonged there. “You just agreed to a future without a syllabus. I’m so
  proud.”

  Roy chuckled, shaking his head. “Don’t get used to it.”

  Levi smirked. “Too late.”

  They sat there for a long moment, the world outside moving forward as it
  always did, but inside that apartment, time felt suspended. There were no neat
  conclusions, no perfect endings. Just the promise of something real, something
  unknown, something worth the risk.

  A New Kind of Future

  Levi shifted slightly, resting his head against Roy’s shoulder. “So, what’s
  the first thing you’re going to do now that you’ve agreed to an unpredictable
  future?”

  Roy considered it for a moment. “Probably regret it,” he deadpanned.

  Levi laughed, nudging him. “Liar. You love it.”

  Roy smirked. “I tolerate it.”

  Levi turned his head slightly, eyes flickering with something playful yet
  deep. “You know, there’s something exciting about not having all the answers.
  Makes room for possibilities.”

  Roy exhaled, feeling the weight of his old life peeling away, layer by layer.
  “Possibilities, huh?”

  Levi nodded. “Yeah. Like where we’ll be in a year. Or where we’ll end up
  tomorrow. Or whether or not you’ll finally admit you actually like me.”

  Roy tilted his head, pretending to think. “The jury’s still out on that.”

  Levi scoffed, but his hand squeezed Roy’s just a little tighter. “We’ll see
  about that.”

  For the first time in his life, Roy wasn’t afraid of the uncertainty. He
  wasn’t trying to solve it, control it, or fit it into a neatly categorized
  plan. He was just living it.

  And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.


  The End.
