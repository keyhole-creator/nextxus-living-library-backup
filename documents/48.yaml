  Experiments with Sanity\r

  \r

  \r

  We, the Experimentalists, who craft the very tools we study, find wisdom not
  just in theory, but in the trenches of daily toil. Our path is fraught with
  the perils of obsolete data and the siren song of unverified results. This
  codex outlines the truths we have learned to maintain sanity, confidence, and
  the integrity of our work.The Five Imperatives (The C-Challenges)\r

  \r

  \r

  The Experimentalist must confront these fundamental challenges in any
  large-scale evaluation:\r

  1. C1: The Loop of Feedback. Recognize that the act of analysis informs the
  algorithm's evolution. Your process must support this iterative, non-linear
  dance.\r

  2. C2: The Economic Execution. Time, energy, and silicon are finite resources.
  Rerunning everything is the path of the fool. Recompute only what has truly
  changed.\r

  3. C3: The Versioning Mandate. Data and code are ghosts of past choices. To
  compare the present against the past—to find regressions or the seeds of
  bugs—you must be able to go back. Your workflow must be append-only.\r

  4. C4: Machine Independence. Your insights must not be chained to a single
  box. The code and tools must be generalized to thrive in any computational
  setting.\r

  5. C5: Reproducibility-by-Design. The final publication—the sacred table or
  figure—must flow automatically from the experimental setup. Manual
  intervention is the ancestor of error.\r

  The Pillars of Sanity (The Workflow Dimensions)\r

  \r

  \r

  To uphold the Imperatives, you must manage your domain through these five
  dimensions:1. Dataset & Workload Management\r

  * Automation is Divinity: Let a single script manage all data download and
  preprocessing.\r

  * The Shared Artifact: Create and share preprocessed datasets (via S3 or
  HTTP). Spare your collaborators and reviewers the setup toil.\r

  * The Tiny Test: Maintain a small, random dataset. This runs in your
  Continuous Integration (CI), acting as an early warning for regression.\r

  2. Configuration Management\r

  * Banish the Command Line: Limit direct command-line execution to mere
  testing.\r

  * Declare Your Intent: Describe all experiments in version-controlled files
  (YAML is preferred for structure, though Bash is simple).\r

  * The Silent Skip: Implement a mechanism to recognize and skip already-run
  configurations (C2).\r

  3. Infrastructure Management\r

  * The Containerized Home: Provide a containerized development environment
  (e.g., Docker) to ensure a well-defined and predictable environment (C4).\r

  4. Version Everything\r

  * Beyond Git: Source code revision is insufficient. Assign explicit version
  numbers to individual components: datasets, algorithms, and database schemas.
  This granular control enables precise re-runs (C2, C3).\r

  5. Result Management\r

  * The Database is Truth: Abandon CSVs. Use a database (like SQLite for
  simplicity, PostgreSQL for scale) to store results. It is indexed, efficient,
  and resists the parsing burden (C4).\r

  * Schema Evolution: Use schema migrations so the result structure can evolve
  with the project (C3).\r

  * The Provenance Seal: Track the origin (git identifier, configuration file)
  of every result (C5).\r

  * The View of Now: Enforce access to only the most recent results by using
  database views. This is the safeguard against mixing old and new data (C3).\r

  Follow this codex, and you shall find confidence in your analysis, sparing
  yourself the peril and frustration of menial work."
