  # NextXus Cluster Inspector


  ## Overview


  NextXus Cluster Inspector is a federation service monitoring dashboard that
  evaluates and monitors NextXus HumanCodex Federation services. The application
  performs health checks on multiple service URLs, calculates federation
  readiness scores, and provides AI-powered architectural recommendations for
  service improvements.


  The tool is designed for enterprise monitoring, offering data-dense technical
  dashboards with clear status indicators, endpoint testing, framework
  detection, and exportable reports in JSON and Markdown formats.


  ## Philosophical Foundation


  This tool embodies the principles of the **Roger Keyserling Collaboration
  Protocol**:

  - **Truth Before Comfort** - Honest health checks and diagnostics, no false
  positives

  - **Collaboration Over Competition** - Shareable reports for team transparency

  - **Legacy Over Profit** - Built for long-term federation monitoring


  ## Key Features


  ### Three-Tab Interface

  1. **Inspector Tab**: Main health check dashboard with service management,
  cluster notes, federation readiness, and AI analysis

  2. **Analytics Tab**: Historical trend charts showing uptime, response times,
  federation score evolution with time range selectors (24h, 7d, 30d)

  3. **Agent Zero Tab**: "The Guardian of Truth" - autonomous monitoring
  dashboard with:
     - Stats grid: Services Monitored, Verifications Today, Avg Health %, System Uptime
     - Real-time activity feed from WebSocket events
     - Network status grid showing all monitored services with health indicators
     - Capability badges: "Always Watching", "Truth Verified", "Self-Healing"

  ### Advanced Diagnostics

  - **TLS Certificate Monitoring**: Expiry countdown with warning (< 30 days)
  and critical (< 7 days) alerts

  - **Security Headers Analysis**: Checks 6 headers (X-Content-Type-Options,
  X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy)

  - **Error Categorization**: Timeout, DNS failure, connection refused, TLS
  error, HTTP errors with actionable suggestions


  ### Custom AI Templates

  - 4 default templates: General Architecture, Security Focus, Performance
  Optimization, Microservices Migration

  - Template variables: {{serviceUrl}}, {{healthCheck}}, {{clusterNote}},
  {{federationReadiness}}

  - Full CRUD for custom templates via Template Manager dialog


  ### Collaborative Workspace

  - Shareable report links with unique URLs (/shared/:shareId)

  - Expiration options: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, never

  - Read-only public view with expiration warnings

  - Copy-to-clipboard for easy sharing


  ### Auto-Refresh Monitoring

  - Configurable per-service intervals: Off, 30s, 1m, 5m, 15m

  - WebSocket real-time updates for health check results

  - Toast notifications on status changes


  ## System Architecture


  ### Frontend Architecture

  - **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript

  - **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight React router)

  - **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state

  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library (New York style)

  - **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations

  - **Build Tool**: Vite with custom plugins


  ### Backend Architecture

  - **Runtime**: Node.js with Express

  - **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)

  - **API Pattern**: RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix

  - **WebSocket**: `/ws` endpoint for real-time updates

  - **AI Integration**: OpenAI-compatible API for service analysis


  ### Key Components

  - **Inspector.tsx**: Main page with tabs, service management, WebSocket
  handling

  - **AgentZero.tsx**: Guardian dashboard with stats, activity feed, network
  status

  - **AnalyticsDashboard.tsx**: Historical charts with recharts

  - **HealthCheckDashboard.tsx**: Service health details display

  - **DiagnosticsPanel.tsx**: TLS certificate and security headers analysis

  - **ShareReportDialog.tsx**: Create shareable report links

  - **PromptTemplateManager.tsx**: CRUD interface for AI templates


  ### Database

  - **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL

  - **Tables**: services, healthChecks, aiAnalysisRecords, sharedReports,
  promptTemplates


  ## External Dependencies

  - **OpenAI API**: For generating architectural recommendations

  - **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage

  - **TanStack React Query**: Async state management

  - **Radix UI**: Accessible UI primitives

  - **Recharts**: Data visualization

  - **lucide-react**: Icon library
