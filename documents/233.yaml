  Overview\r

  \r

  \r

  Nondisclosure agreements (also called NDAs or confidentiality agreements) have
  become increasingly important for businesses of all sizes, serving as the
  first line of defense in protecting inventions, trade secrets, and hard work.
  These agreements are used when at least one person is sharing confidential
  information with someone else, and protect the immediate and future privacy of
  that disclosed information. Once signed, a nondisclosure agreement allows for
  open dialogue between parties, creating an environment in which information
  can be discussed freely and the true objectives of the meeting or relationship
  can be achieved (for example, a company may be created or a strategic
  partnership may be established).\r

  \r

  \r

  There are two key types of nondisclosure agreements: unilateral and mutual.
  Mutual nondisclosure agreements (like the agreement in this document) should
  be used when both parties will be sharing confidential information, as when
  the parties are considering the creation of a partnership, joint venture, or
  merger. Unilateral nondisclosure agreements should be used when only one side
  will be sharing confidential information, as when one party is seeking funding
  for or investment in a company.\r

  MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\r

  \  \r

  This mutual nondisclosure agreement is between [PARTY ONE NAME], a[n] [State
  of Organization, if not an individual] [Business Type] whose principal address
  is [Full Mailing Address] and [YOUR NAME OR ORGANIZATION NAME], a[n] [State of
  Organization, if not an individual] [Business Type] whose principal address is
  [Full Mailing Address].\r

  \                \r

  Each party has developed certain confidential information that it may disclose
  to the other party for the purpose of [why the parties are exchanging
  information].\r

  \                \r

  The parties therefore agree as follows:\r

  \r

  \r

  1.        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\r

  \r

  \r

  Each party (in such capacity, a “Disclosing Party”) may disclose certain of
  its confidential and proprietary information to the other party (in such
  capacity, a “Receiving Party”). “Confidential Information” means:\r

  \r

  \r

  (a)        information relating to the Disclosing Party or its current or
  proposed business, including financial statements, budgets and projections,
  customer identifying information, potential and intended customers, employers,
  products, computer programs, specifications, manuals, software, analyses,
  strategies, marketing plans, business plans, and other confidential
  information, whether provided orally, in writing, or by any other media, that
  was or will be:\r

  \r

  \r

  1. provided or shown to the Receiving Party by or on behalf of the Disclosing
  Party; or\r

  \r

  \r

  2. obtained by the Receiving Party from review of documents or property of, or
  communications with, the Disclosing Party; and\r

  \r

  \r

  (b)        all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries, and other
  material, whether provided orally, in writing, or by any other media, that
  contain or are based on the information described in subsection (a) (the
  “Derivative Materials”).\r

  \        \r

  The Disclosing Party shall identify Confidential Information disclosed orally
  within a reasonable time after disclosure, although failure to identify
  information as Confidential Information is not an acknowledgment or admission
  that that information is not confidential.\r

  \r

  \r

  2.        OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.\r

  \r

  \r

  (a)        Confidentiality. The Receiving Party shall keep the Confidential
  Information confidential. Except as otherwise required by law, the Receiving
  Party may not:\r

  \        \r

  1. disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than:\r

  \r

  \r

  \   1. a Receiving Party representative who needs to know the Confidential
  Information for the purposes of its business with the Disclosing Party;\r

  \r

  \r

  \   2. a Receiving Party representative who signs a confidentiality agreement;
  and\r

  \r

  \r

  \   3. with the Disclosing Party’s prior written authorization; or\r

  \r

  \r

  2. use the Confidential Information for any purposes other than those
  contemplated by this agreement.\r

  \r

  \r

  (b)        No Reverse Engineering. The Receiving Party may not reverse
  engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes, software, or other
  tangible objects that embody the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information
  and that are provided to the Receiving Party under this agreement.  \r

  \r

  \r

  (c)        Term. The Receiving Party shall maintain the confidentiality and
  security of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information until the earlier
  of: (i) such time as all Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
  disclosed under this agreement becomes publicly known and is made generally
  available through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party or (ii)
  [Number] years from the date of disclosure. However, to the extent that the
  Disclosing Party has disclosed information to the Receiving Party that
  constitutes a trade secret under law, the Receiving Party shall protect that
  trade secret for as long as the information qualifies as a trade secret. \r

  \r

  \r

  3.        EXCLUSIONS.\r

  \r

  \r

  The obligations and restrictions of this agreement do not apply to that part
  of the Confidential Information that the Receiving Party demonstrates:\r

  \                        \r

  \   1. was or becomes generally publicly available other than as a result of a
  disclosure by the Receiving Party in violation of this agreement;\r

  \r

  \r

  \   2. was or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential
  basis before its disclosure to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party,
  but only if:\r

  \r

  \r

  1. the source of such information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
  with the Disclosing Party or is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the
  information to the Receiving Party by a contractual, legal, fiduciary, or
  other obligation; and\r

  \r

  \r

  2. the Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party with written notice of
  such prior possession either (A) before the execution and delivery of this
  agreement or (B) if the Receiving Party later becomes aware (through
  disclosure to the Receiving Party) of any aspect of the Confidential
  Information as to which the Receiving Party had prior possession, promptly on
  the Receiving Party so becoming aware; or\r

  \r

  \r

  \   3. is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories,
  requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal
  investigative demand, or similar process), or is required by a regulatory
  body, to be disclosed. However, the Receiving Party shall: \r

  \r

  \r

  1. provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of any such request or
  requirement before disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek an
  appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy; and\r

  \r

  \r

  2. provide reasonable assistance to the Disclosing Party in obtaining any such
  protective order. \r

  \r

  \r

  \        If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the
  Disclosing Party grants a waiver under this agreement, then the Receiving
  Party may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential
  Information that, in the written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
  the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party is legally compelled or otherwise
  required to disclose. The Receiving Party shall make reasonable efforts to
  obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any
  part of the Confidential Information so disclosed; or\r

  \r

  \r

  \   4. was developed by the Receiving Party independently without breach of
  this agreement.\r

  \r

  \r

  4.        RETURN OF PROPERTY.\r

  \r

  \r

  All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing
  Confidential Information that have been disclosed by either party to the other
  party, and all copies in the possession of the other party, are and will
  remain the property of the Disclosing Party. At the Disclosing Party’s
  request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all of those
  documents or objects.\r

  \r

  \r

  5.        OWNERSHIP RIGHTS. \r

  \r

  \r

  Each party acknowledges that the Confidential Information is and will be the
  Disclosing Party’s sole property, even if suggestions made by the Receiving
  Party are incorporated into the Confidential Information. Neither party
  obtains any rights, by license or otherwise, in the other party’s Confidential
  Information. Neither party solicits any change in the other party’s
  organization, business practice, service, or products, and the disclosure of
  the Confidential Information may not be construed as evidencing any intent by
  a party to purchase any products or services of the other party or as an
  encouragement to expend funds in development or research efforts. The
  Confidential Information may pertain to prospective or unannounced products.
  Neither party may use the other party’s Confidential Information as a basis on
  which to develop or have a third party develop a competing or similar plan or
  undertaking. \r

  \r

  \r

  6.        NO OBLIGATION.\r

  \r

  \r

  Nothing in this agreement obligates either party to proceed with any
  transaction between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole
  discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this agreement
  concerning the business opportunity, if any, and to cease further disclosures,
  communications, or other activities under this agreement on written notice to
  the other party. Any commitment to proceed with a transaction will be set
  forth in a separate agreement signed by the parties.\r

  \r

  \r

  7.        NO WARRANTY.\r

  \r

  \r

  ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY
  WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACCURACY,
  COMPLETENESS, OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION.\r

  \r

  \r

  8.        MISCELLANEOUS.\r

  \r

  \r

  1. Choice of Law. The laws of the state of [State] govern this agreement
  (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles).\r

  \r

  \r

  2. Equitable Relief. The parties acknowledge that a breach of this agreement
  will cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party and monetary damages may
  not be a sufficient remedy for an unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential
  Information. If a Receiving Party discloses the Confidential Information in
  violation of this agreement, a Disclosing Party may, without waiving any other
  rights or remedies and without posting a bond or other security, seek an
  injunction, specific performance, or other equitable remedy to prevent
  competition or further disclosure, and may pursue other legal remedies. \r

  \r

  \r

  3. Amendments. No amendment to this agreement will be effective unless it is
  in writing and signed by a party or its authorized representative.\r

  \r

  \r

  4. No Assignment. Neither party may assign any of its rights or delegate any
  performance under this agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
  other party. \r

  \r

  \r

  5. Electronic Signatures. This agreement, agreements ancillary to this
  agreement, and related documents entered into in connection with this
  agreement are signed when a party’s signature is delivered electronically, and
  these signatures must be treated in all respects as having the same force and
  effect as original signatures.\r

  \r

  \r

  6. Severability. If any provision in this agreement is, for any reason, held
  to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity,
  illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this
  agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if the invalid, illegal, or
  unenforceable provisions had never been contained in this agreement, unless
  the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change that
  would cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to
  be unreasonable.\r

  \r

  \r

  7. Waiver. No waiver of a breach, failure of any condition, or any right or
  remedy contained in or granted by the provisions of this agreement will be
  effective unless it is in writing and signed by the party waiving the breach,
  failure, right, or remedy. No waiver of any breach, failure, right, or remedy
  will be deemed a waiver of any other breach, failure, right, or remedy,
  whether or not similar, and no waiver will constitute a continuing waiver,
  unless the writing so specifies.\r

  \r

  \r

  8. Entire Agreement. This agreement constitutes the final agreement of the
  parties. It is the complete and exclusive expression of the parties’ agreement
  with respect to the subject matter of this agreement. \r

  \r

  \r

  9. Effectiveness. This agreement will become effective when all parties have
  signed it. The date this agreement is signed by the last party to sign it (as
  indicated by the date associated with that party’s signature) will be deemed
  the date of this agreement. \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  Each party is signing this agreement on the date stated opposite that party’s
  signature. \r
