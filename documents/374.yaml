  # Omega Academy - Civic & Governance Center


  ## Overview


  This is a comprehensive educational platform for civic and governmental
  operations built as a full-stack web application. The system provides a
  12-week structured curriculum covering government systems, legislative
  processes, public administration, and civic engagement. The platform features
  interactive simulations, discussion forums, assignment management, progress
  tracking, and certification systems to create an immersive learning experience
  for students studying governance and public service.


  ## User Preferences


  Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.


  ## System Architecture


  ### Frontend Architecture

  The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, using a modern
  component-based architecture. The UI framework leverages shadcn/ui components
  built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for
  styling. The application uses Wouter for client-side routing and TanStack
  Query for state management and server synchronization. The frontend is
  organized into logical modules including pages, components (layout, dashboard,
  course-specific), hooks for data fetching, and utilities.


  ### Backend Architecture

  The server is implemented using Express.js with TypeScript in ESM format. The
  application follows a layered architecture with clear separation between
  routes, business logic, and data access. The main entry point sets up
  middleware for JSON parsing, request logging, and error handling. The routing
  system handles authentication, user management, course operations, and API
  endpoints for all educational features. A storage abstraction layer provides a
  clean interface for database operations.


  ### Database Design

  The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM for
  type-safe database operations and migrations. The schema is well-structured
  with tables for users, courses, course modules, enrollments, assignments,
  submissions, discussions, user progress, achievements, and simulations. The
  database design supports the educational workflow with proper relationships
  between entities and includes features like progress tracking, grading
  systems, and achievement management.


  ### Authentication & Authorization

  The application implements a simplified authentication system suitable for
  educational environments. User sessions are managed server-side, and the
  system supports role-based access with different permission levels for
  students, instructors, and administrators. The authentication flow includes
  login endpoints and user session management.


  ### Course Management System

  The platform organizes learning content into a 12-week structured curriculum
  with modular design. Each course consists of multiple modules (weeks) that
  contain learning objectives, content, assignments, and assessments. The system
  tracks user progress through courses and maintains completion status for
  individual modules and overall course progress.


  ### Interactive Features

  The application includes several interactive educational components:

  - **Simulations**: Hands-on coding exercises and government scenario
  simulations

  - **Discussion Forums**: Module-based threaded discussions with reply systems

  - **Assignment System**: Multiple assignment types (quizzes, projects, essays)
  with due date tracking

  - **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive analytics on user learning progress and
  performance

  - **Achievement System**: Gamified learning with badges and certifications


  ### Data Management

  The system uses TanStack Query for efficient client-side data fetching,
  caching, and synchronization. This provides optimistic updates, background
  refetching, and proper error handling. The query system is configured with
  custom fetch functions that handle authentication and error responses
  consistently across the application.
