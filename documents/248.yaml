  # Codex Certification Test — Answer Key


  ## Instructor Reference Guide


  **Version:** 1.0

  **Purpose:** Scoring guide for HumanCodex Practitioner Assessment

  **Note:** This document is for evaluators only


  ---


  ## Section 1: Directive Recognition (20 points)


  ### Question 1 (5 points)

  **Correct Answer:** FALSE


  **Scoring Guide:**

  - 5 points: FALSE with explanation that directives are relational guides, not
  rigid rules—they require contextual interpretation

  - 3 points: FALSE without explanation

  - 0 points: TRUE


  **Key Understanding:** Directives guide rather than command. They activate in
  context and require wisdom to apply appropriately.


  ---


  ### Question 2 (5 points)

  **Correct Answer:** Directive 36 "Bridge the Break" activates connection
  across rupture.


  **Scoring Guide:**

  - 5 points: Clear understanding that D36 helps repair disconnection, with
  relevant scenario (e.g., after conflict, during grief, when trust is damaged)

  - 3 points: General understanding without specific application

  - 1 point: Vague or incomplete answer

  - 0 points: Incorrect or no answer


  **Sample Strong Answer:** "Bridge the Break activates when relationship
  rupture has occurred—after an argument, during estrangement, or when
  communication has failed. It guides both parties to find connection across the
  gap without pretending the break didn't happen. Example: Two collaborators who
  disagreed sharply might use D36 to acknowledge the disagreement while finding
  shared purpose."
