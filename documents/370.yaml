  # NextXus Podcast Studio


  ## Overview

  NextXus Podcast Studio is a full-stack platform for managing podcasts and
  generating AI-powered audio. It converts text into podcast episodes,
  supporting both single-narrator and two-voice dialogue formats. The platform
  aims to streamline podcast production through AI-driven content generation,
  sophisticated audio rendering, and intelligent content analysis. Key features
  include AI script generation, text-to-speech via ElevenLabs, segment-based
  editing, PDF and audio import, and integrations for publishing. The long-term
  vision is to evolve into a content intelligence hub, offering meaning-aware
  production capabilities and advanced content verification.


  ## User Preferences

  - **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language

  - **Design philosophy**: Mobile-first, no sidebars, full-width content

  - **Long-term goal**: Content intelligence and meaning-aware production


  ## System Architecture


  ### Tech Stack

  - **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, TanStack React Query

  - **UI**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS (dark theme with gold accents)

  - **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript

  - **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM

  - **AI/TTS**: ElevenLabs API (eleven_multilingual_v2), OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

  - **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg

  - **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OpenID Connect)


  ### Core Features & Design

  - **Podcast Management**: Organize podcasts and episodes, supporting monologue
  and dialogue formats.

  - **Episode Creation**: Create episodes from user input, URL extraction, or
  PDF uploads with automatic chapter detection.

  - **Script Editor**: Segment-based script editing with individual speaker
  turns, allowing per-segment rendering and dirty detection based on content
  hashing.

  - **Audio Generation Pipeline**:
    1. **Script Creation**: User or AI generates script, split into segments.
    2. **Segment Rendering**: Each segment rendered independently via ElevenLabs, tracking render versions.
    3. **Episode Assembly**: FFmpeg concatenates rendered segments, mixing in optional intro/outro sounds and background music.
  - **Content Intelligence**: Semantic analysis of segments, providing topic
  tags, sentiment, emotional tone, and pacing recommendations.

  - **Reliability Layer (Agent Zero)**: A self-healing system monitoring
  pipeline events, retrying failed operations, and verifying output integrity
  using a DB-backed job queue.

  - **Authentication**: User authentication via Replit Auth, API key
  authentication for external systems, and HMAC signing for webhooks.


  ### Database Schema Highlights

  - **podcasts**: Container for episodes, defining podcast type
  (monologue/dialogue).

  - **episodes**: Stores episode metadata, script content, audio settings, and
  status.

  - **episode_segments**: The source of truth for content, storing individual
  script sections, speaker turns, content hashes for dirty detection, and
  versioning.

  - **segment_renders**: Immutable records of audio render artifacts per segment
  version.

  - **segment_analysis**: Stores results from content intelligence (e.g., topic
  tags, sentiment).

  - **Integration Tables**: podbean_connections, podbean_publications, api_keys,
  webhooks manage external integrations.

  - **Agent Zero Tables**: agent_zero_jobs for job queuing and agent_zero_events
  for an append-only event log.


  ## External Dependencies


  - **ElevenLabs API**: Used for high-quality text-to-speech audio rendering
  (eleven_multilingual_v2 model).

  - **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Employed for AI-powered script generation and
  content intelligence tasks.

  - **Podbean**: Integrated for OAuth-based account connection and direct
  episode publishing.

  - **Replit Auth**: Utilized for user authentication, providing secure login
  through OpenID Connect.

  - **FFmpeg**: An external tool used by the backend for audio processing,
  concatenation, and mixing of effects.

  - **PostgreSQL**: The primary database for persistent storage, managed via
  Drizzle ORM.

  - **pdf-parse library**: Used on the backend for extracting text and detecting
  chapters from uploaded PDF files.
