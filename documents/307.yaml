  Suppose you want to have anybody you want. Or you Need To Find someone to
  spend your life with? Or, if you're going for a sexy Mr. Right now. With
  Almost 50 years of experience with all types of men, I learned a lot. The 150
  men I employed shared what they knew about men  with me in great detail. \r

  Interestingly, we associate seduction with sex when in fact, true seduction is
  not sex. Seduction is not about the culmination or gratification of desire. It
  is about the thrill of the desire in itself. It is the thrill of the game that
  is played. It is exciting as the urge comes closer and closer to happening.
  Maintaining that tension of wanting, seeking and waiting for a long time is
  best. Seduction is about making him want and like you. It is not necessarily
  about letting him have you. \r

  I try in my stories to include detailed information. I share the good, the
  bad, and everything in between.\r

  Below is a Summarized version of who I am. \r

  I was born and started school in New York. And then, my family relocated when
  my sister was due to be born in the Midwest. I was about five years old then.
  \r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  We lived in town, my grandmother and uncle lived in the country. And my
  great-grandmother lived in town in a huge old house. \r

  I was a very outgoing, cute kid. My parents both worked for the government and
  were incredible parents. I was given many more opportunities than most kids
  could imagine. \r

  I was a year younger than all the kids in my grade because they advanced me to
  a higher grade. \r

  \r

  I was never a big burly guy like all the other farmers from this area.  I was
  raised Mormon. And I did adhere to all religious practices, no drugs, no sex,
  nothing. I was considered an egghead and an outsider from the beginning. \r

  I was already into everything. Often I went door to door selling seeds and
  cards. Merlite jewelry too. I was always an entrepreneur. \r

  Unfortunately, in a small town, every male must play sports. I was in Boy
  Scouts and Cub Scouts, and I got my Eagle very young and every merit badge and
  award you can imagine, including some very difficult ones. \r

  I had a very rude awakening about sex. Three older guys at scout camp educated
  me, let's just say I wasn't sure if I was being beaten or what was happening.
  That's how I  found out what sex was. I told nobody at all. \r

  Similar situations happened from till I was 16. Sports was a particular
  nightmare. It occurred to me in the shower I was attracted to guys, but I
  never tried to get any. They did come for me on a few occasions.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Finally, I turned 16, and I had a job in Kansas 😞. So I was available to go
  and meet gay men. \r

  OneeTheyof them, Bruce, happened to be a bartender in a bar I should not have
  been in. He began the process of my healing and discovering myself because I
  was still in the Theyteverywhere else. In \r

  College came, and in college, I was with a football player and a theater
  technician. Both were in relationships with me during college at the same time
  until I decided that Steve, Theater Technician, was not as sexy but could have
  a conversation and walk at the same time. Haha,  yes, the football player was
  excellent, but to look at him only, I needed more than a vacant brain.\r

  After college Steve, and I worked for the Department of Mental health. I
  specialized in behavioral analysis.  I spent almost six years with Steve. \r

  In California, I fell in love with two men, one surfer and one Latin, who
  lived at the tip of Baja, Mexico. \r

  \r

  \r

  I moved to Texas after several other cities where I conducted business, but in
  Texas, I opened my largest company called keyhole production studios. I had
  over 150 performers, and they had bookings all over the place. Megabucks! I
  was young and attractive and could have danced myself. I knew that I had to
  draw lines for business to be proper. A must if you want to conduct business
  with big industry.  I made a business of high-class performances with stage
  lights and big theater productions. I did very well.  \r

  \  \r

  \r

  During that time, the only relationship I had was with one of my dancers.
  However, it was a family situation with the wife and the kids, and me. I did
  that for a very long time until I was carjacked and died literally and came
  back, but because of my injury, I lost all of my business and wealth. \r

  My business continued for a little bit, and then all of my performers got
  other contracts. However, the situation with the male dancer continued long
  after my company closed. As I said, I was family. I realized the shallowness
  of my needs in this situation and decided to let the dancer go and go with a
  man that I have been with for more than 20 years. \r

  Your first-time gay sexual experience can never be repeated, so it’s important
  to set the stage for a great emergence into your gay sexuality to lay a
  positive foundation from the get-go. This should not be entered into casually
  — as it can either affirm a healthy sexuality or leave lasting scars depending
  on how you negotiate this very important developmental milestone. Your first
  time is special and can set the tone for your sexuality for a long time to
  come.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  At 54  I decided to check out dating again. Boy, that's a nightmare. I
  genuinely worry for the younger generation at the shallow, meaningless
  encounters, digital and random, programmed with continuous similar speech and
  conversation, all of which have to be checked out if they even bother because
  the meeting is typically a hookup for an hour never seen again. Not to say
  that it does not have its place, but there is no option for any engagement or
  value exchange beyond the most minimal levels. But even in such an
  environment, I managed to find a few options. No relationship type meeting but
  Friends with benefits type. \r

  ________________\r

  Essential things to remember when you are in a serious relationship: \r

  1. Don't ever assume your partner feels loved. \r

  2. Date nights are a must. \r

  3. The most critical relationship tip is that communication is vital. There
  will be times when you make each other upset, or maybe you won't agree. It is
  essential to ensure that you are communicating your feelings with one another.
  \r

  4. Your partner is not a mind reader. \r

  5. It doesn't matter if you go out or stay in. \r

  6. Talking openly about what you want to change in your relationship is
  essential. \r

  7. Learn each other's love expressions\r

  8. We all don't perceive love the same way. \r

  9. Go to bed mad sometimes, don't force a resolution. Sleeping on it does
  help. \r

  10. When you get into a fight, don't just say I'm sorry. Say what you are
  sorry for and react differently next time. \r

  11. It will get boring. Sometimes every couple goes through the tedious stage.
  It's normal, and it will fade. This is the time in your relationship you will
  have to put the most effort in some days. \r

  12. You will have to pull more weight than your partner and vice versa. It's
  essential to check in on each other's mental health. \r

  13. It's okay to go to couples counseling. It helps. It doesn't mean you are
  ending or failing trust. \r

  14. This is a big one. All healthy relationships require mutual and unguarded
  trust between partners, regardless of what either partner has experienced in
  the past, like a cheating ex or a parent's divorce. \r

  15. In a healthy relationship, your partner will trust you completely. Do
  remember that it takes time to build trust in a relationship. It usually
  doesn't come right off the bat, and when your partner fully trusts you with
  their feelings, you should respect them and not betray them. \r

  16. Cheating on them or doing things to make them jealous isn't right. On the
  flip side, if you don't trust your partner, you shouldn't be with them. \r

  17. Don't ever let your partner use their lack of trust or past experiences as
  an excuse to control you. You must earn their trust. Genuine affection,
  support, respect, and communication will naturally screen the faith in your
  relationship. \r

  18. Talk about money. Talk about your financial goals. Let your partner know
  what you expect from them, and vice versa. \r

  19. Turn off the phones an hour before bedtime and talk to each other. Ask
  questions like What do you need to see more from me? How can we understand
  each other better and, most importantly, be kind to each other? Love each
  other, and fight for each other's communication. \r

  Make an effort every day\r

  Develop your own “you” outside of your identity as a couple\r

  Be transparent about your sexual role and preferences\r

  Make sure you understand what your partner means by “relationship”\r

  Work on developing emotional intimacy\r

  Keep past relationships in the past\r

  Protect each other physically\r

  Protect each other legally\r

  Schedule a weekly evening for quality time together. \r

  As a gay person, you may have had your share of societal disapproval in this
  heterosexually-dominated world. But you have held on tight to what you know is
  your sexual orientation, and now find yourself in a great relationship.\r

  You are finally comfortable in your skin and you want to make sure that you
  stay happily coupled in your gay relationship.\r

  However, gay or lesbian dating advice or relationship advice would suggest
  that you must be aware of certain essential things to have a happy
  relationship.\r

  But, what are these sex and relationship advice to sustain a happy and
  satisfying same-sex relationship?\r

  You love your partner and want to show them love every day. It doesn’t need to
  be a big demonstration of feelings; bringing them a hot cup of coffee made
  just the way they like it can be enough to send a message that you care about
  them.\r

  As a gay person, you may have had your share of societal disapproval in this
  heterosexually-dominated world. But you have held on tight to what you know is

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  When you are long past the heady, blissful beginning days of your
  relationship, continuing to do small, loving gestures for each other will go a
  long way in showing that your gay relationship partner is significant.\r

  This is very important relationship advice for anyone but is definitely
  important in gay relationships.\r

  Be yourself and also, leave your inhibitions at the door. The key to dating
  successfully. Go in thinking that the guy is going to be a maybe. That way, if
  nothing is going to happen, you’re not left feeling disappointed. Still, give
  him your attention and the opportunity to impress you. If it doesn’t work out,
  that’s fine because you had low expectations, but if it does, you will be
  pleasantly surprised.\r

  Do not waste time! Get fit, hitched, and start a business - you have the other
  half of your life to look forward to, but by becoming a better person. You
  know when you do things wrong or are being used. You feel remorse afterward.
  Try doing something right. Answer your phone, don’t shut down your life. Help
  people around you who deserve it.\r

  Never rule out a type of person because they don’t fit what you’re customarily
  attracted to. Be open to all different kinds of guys. This widens your options
  significantly.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  When it comes to foreplay there is nothing off-limits. The more that you are
  prepared to experiment, the more likely that you will hit his sweet spots.
  However, it’s best to go with what feels natural to you rather than trying to
  copy what you have seen in your most recent porn ventures. With such intimacy,
  it’s very easy to spot if somebody is being themselves or playing a role. Just
  do you – but you are at your most sexually adventurous.\r

  Develop your own “you” outside of your identity as a couple\r

  When gay partners come together, like straight couples, it is natural to
  experience a sense of fusion, a state where you do everything together. It is
  thrilling to have finally found someone that “gets” you and you want to spend
  each waking and sleeping moment together.\r

  But healthy gay relationships need breathing room to keep things interesting.
  Avoid the temptation to look to your partner to fulfill all your emotional and
  intellectual needs.\r

  Even though you may be head over heels in love, this gay relationship advice
  implores you to carve out time to maintain your outside separate interests and
  continue to work on self-development, \r

  I want to reiterate. You've heard that cliche communication is critical. But
  here's the thing, Good communication is one of the most important aspects of a
  healthy relationship. \r

  Make sure you understand what your partner means by “relationship”\r

  It is no secret that in the gay subculture, “relationship” can mean many
  things. If for you it means being exclusive, you’ll want to make sure that is
  compatible with your partner’s views as well.\r

  If you both wish to keep the relationship open to include other people,
  outline what that means. Does it mean continuing to frequent gay bars solo?\r

  Would you prefer a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, or would you require
  complete transparency from your partner when they see other people?\r

  When starting a new relationship, you must discuss what you both want and
  expect. Sometimes this means being honest and having uncomfortable
  conversations. But if you're in a healthy relationship, your partner will be
  receptive and listen, and you should do the same. You are on the same page as
  your partner goes a long way and opening up to your partner about what's
  bothering you. Compromising your disagreements and complementing each other
  are all equally as important. While communication is essential, you should
  both be comfortable with how often you talk to one another if your partner
  needs you always to answer right away and text them all day long. And you
  don't want that. That's not healthy. On the flip side, if your partner is
  always ignoring your texts and it doesn't make you feel good, that's not
  healthy either. Finding a communication balance that you're both comfortable
  with is super important. Remember, love is never easy, and it's a ride. But
  damn, is it ever beautiful and worth it. \r

  A good story teller doesn’t tell his plot or end of the story at the start of
  his story, the same rules apply for foreplay. If you give too much too soon,
  you miss out on the wonderful feeling of the climb. Start slow and slowly
  build – the slower the better. Time goes much quicker when we are receiving
  the pleasure rather than giving it (although giving it should be fun too!) –
  keep this in mind as you are pleasing your man. When you think it’s time to
  move on, go on a little bit more for good measure. \r

  Protect each other legally\r

  If you are at the stage of your same-sex relationship where you are ready to
  tie the knot, check with your State’s or country’s’ laws to see if gay
  marriage is legally allowed.\r

  \r

  \r

  If it is not yet legal, research how you might legally protect your partner so
  that they have spousal rights such as power-of-attorney, medical benefits, or
  death benefits.\r

  \r

  \r

  \"Tom\"\r

  \ I have realized that we were specially created for each other. And that is
  the very reason our souls are compatible. I adore you much more than I can
  find words to tell you. \r

  I think of what you told me when we talked on the phone. I hear your loving
  words and how much you said I mean to you. It makes me happy replaying your
  loving words in my head when I am missing you. \r

  We're still trying to find our voice and figure out what we want to say. But
  if you're there with me, I know that no matter how scary the world can seem,
  everything will be okay.\r

  might do when I get home from work.\r

  \r

  \r

  I will walk in the door and immediately grab you. I pull you close and hold
  you tight. I suck your nipples as I finger you under your clothes. I will then
  move your hand to my cock so you can play with it. \r

  \r

  \r

  You put it in and I feel your mouth around my swollen dick as it throbs inside
  your mouth you're sucking it up and down. It's a beautiful sight seeing your
  face bobbing up and down on my cock. My juice is running out of your pretty
  lips. I feel the heat of the fluid dripping over my balls. I am now on my back
  and you're in between my legs sucking me. \r

  as far apart as I can get them. I continue to fuck as deep and hard as I can.
  Pulling out almost completely then thrusting in different rhythm and angles
  inch by inch over and over. Your moans and cries of pleasure excite me more
  and I thrust even harder and faster moving my hips side to side banging my
  pelvis you feel my balls slapping against your ass.  my dick swells huge and I
  pull out and shoot hot cum all over your butt and back then thrusting in you
  start pumping you for round two. \r

  Now, having in mind what constitutes a great orgasm – and how it is associated
  with wonderful sex positions. \r

  There’s more to a healthy relationship than sex, but it’s impossible to deny
  the importance of a great sex life and sexual compatibility in most
  relationships. With a few exceptions, most people in a relationship admit that
  the sexual chemistry and energy they feel is part of what keeps their
  relationship going…\r

  Even among people who have been together for several years, there is always
  the awareness that their sex life has to be kept fresh to prevent ennui from
  setting in. That is how vital great sex is in a relationship, and it’s the
  same for gay relationships.\r

  \r

  \r

  Whether you’re in a traditional monogamous relationship, an open relationship,
  or even a polyamorous one, a sex life that’s constantly evolving and
  improving, as well as partners who are willing to experiment and try new
  things, are key to maintaining a fun relationship. Experimenting with a sex
  practice does not necessarily mean that you have to adopt it, but by trying
  several, you’ll be sure to come across one or two activities that you and your
  partners agree on.\r

  \r

  \r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Even though it may not seem sexy to you, it’s essential that you become
  knowledgeable about safe sex practices and sexually transmitted infections and
  how to protect yourself and those you may potentially sleep with. It’s
  recommended that your first time be with someone you know well, feel safe
  with, and can trust since sex is a very personal and vulnerable experience.
  Assertive communication is key as you will need to speak with your partner
  about such issues as safer sex, STD-status, discussing sexual preferences and
  needs, etc.\r

  \r

  \r

  It’s also recommended that you go slow and try vanilla sex first in a paced
  fashion. Sometimes it’s best to avoid penetrative sex at first and just stick
  to kissing, touching, mutual masturbation, and oral sex and gradually work
  yourself into deeper forms of intimacy. You may have been waiting a long time
  to experiment with your gay sexual self, but you want to ensure it’s a
  positive and pleasurable experience that enriches your life.\r

  Here are a few spicy gay positions to drive your lover crazy with lust. \r

  Kneeling Oral Sex\r

  This position is great when you want to skip penetration and just get your
  rock off. It is even sweeter when you stroke your partner’s cock while pushing
  your dick down his throat. You can hold onto the headboard of the bed to give
  yourself more leverage in trusting while your partner licks and sucks, which
  adds to the pleasure.\r

  Make your partner lie on his back. Kneel over them with your knees on either
  side of his head. It is important to bring your cock close enough to your
  partner’s lips so that he can easily take you into his mouth.\r

  Danseur\r

  The name of this position is ‘dancer’ in French, and this position requires
  you to have as much flexibility and stamina as one. You can think of this as a
  form of extended doggy, and the bottom must have superb balance.\r

  He bends over at the waist, bracing himself against the wall or a chair, and
  lifts one leg up so that he’s balanced on only one leg. The top now stands
  behind him and penetrates him from behind. It’s a great way to get a light
  workout and scratch an itch at the same time if you get what we mean.\r

  \r

  \r

  Pile Driver\r

  A necessary essential for this position is a flexible bottom. That aside, this
  is probably one of the most intense and pleasurable positions for gay sex.
  Both the top and bottom are in their element, so to speak. The bottom gets to
  lie back and receive maximum penetration, while the top is in full control, as
  he has to do the thrusting. For this position, you need a couch or a bed of
  medium height.\r

  \r

  \r

  The bottom lies on the ground with their back flat against it. Their legs are
  raised so that they are at ninety degrees to his body. He then spreads his
  legs while the top squats over him, legs on either side of his body. He then
  ducks the bottom by moving as if he’s doing squats. He can also grip the
  bottom’s legs and hold them wide open, while the bottom can stroke his dick
  with one hand.\r

  \r

  \r

  and show him a great time.\r

  \r

  \r

  When you enter him, go slow at first and let him get used to accommodating
  your member into his body. Monitor his reactions as you increase the speed and
  depth of your thrusts to ensure he’s feeling pleasure and enjoying the
  experience before you switch to Energizer Bunny mode to avoid hurting him. Use
  lots of lubrication and vary the positions and methods to spice things up and
  experience more pleasure.\r

  I found the dating world can be a complicated world to navigate. \r

  If you love, you will have a broken heart.\r

  Getting your heart broken is the worst feeling ever. And it can be tough to
  know what to say to someone who broke your heart. It is normal to love
  someone, even after they break your heart. The danger is when you keep hanging
  on to that person long after the heartbreak because, in my experience, I can
  tell you that it is damaging to your life. The best advice I give people
  immediately after a breakup is to say nothing and walk away as if it didn't
  bother them. Love doesn't always end with a happy ending. It comes with the
  whole package that includes heartbreak to getting your heart broken by someone
  normal. The hurt you feel is acceptable. Remind yourself never to let the pain
  scare you off from being in love ever again. Everyone goes through this and
  survives. So will you when you get heartbroken or you break up with someone.
  One of the things we do is blame them, which may be justified to work though
  they are hurt when we first look at them. Yes. For example, You disgust me.
  You broke me. You made me think that you would always be there. You lied over
  and over again. You made me believe in something and then took it away. You
  didn't care. You acted as if you cared. But it was another lie. You wasted my
  time. You caused me pain. I felt scared. You left me all alone. You let me
  think it was my fault. You taught me not to trust anyone. You taught me not to
  trust myself. You played games that only you could when you monopolized my
  mind. You made me feel like a different person. You made me feel weak. You
  made me feel empty. You made me cry. You gave upon us. You left. Then after a
  little bit of time of being angry and pointing the finger, we begin to
  internalize our pain and start looking at ourselves. For example, I deserve
  better. I never needed you. I didn't think I could do it on my own. I was
  honest. I believed in you. I believed in us. I cared. I put my time in. I
  thought we were naive. I didn't pick up on the signs. I couldn't play your
  games. I thought that I meant something. As we look inward, our thoughts start
  changing. We start putting it all together. Then, for example, I learned that
  I did mean something. I realized that I could do it on my own. I learned that
  I was capable of love. I learned that I didn't have to be broken. I knew that
  I was better than that. I now know what I want. And it isn't you. I am a new
  person. I build myself back up. I am stronger because of you. I am confident.
  I am happy. I don't hate you. After we get done playing that you and I game.
  It's time to start healing and stop looking at the past. Start looking at what
  you're going to do with the future. You will do better by learning from past
  experiences. Accept what had happened and let it all go. It would be best if
  you faced reality. It's never easy at first. Heartbreak can be bitter. You
  will grow by going through this. The next time someone breaks your heart,
  you'll be able to handle it without as much pain. Staying positive is a must
  if you want to forget that someone broke your heart. Don't let the experience
  make you a pessimist just because it didn't work out. It doesn't mean that the
  next one won't be successful, either. \r

  I’m all alone in the gym and I’m working out on the machines I have my
  headphones on and since nobody was there I just was wearing gym shorts without
  a shirt. I’m lifting and jamming to music and enjoying my evening workout. All
  of a sudden I heard this loud thump. I recognized the sound of the bench press
  Bar coming down on its support. I didn’t realize that someone had come in.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  Fuck! Shit! Damn! I hear being shouted. I remove my headphones and set them up
  and directly across from me I see a professional football player. I recognized
  him immediately. He was not from the local team. I knew that he had just
  played in the stadium that day. Let us call him Adam. He was on the phone
  pissed off. “Sorry man, I snuck away from the press. Bastards, They just keep
  bothering me.” Adam said. I could see he was really upset. I just said in a
  friendly way. “No wonder they do with all of your wins, your statistics, and
  popularity.” Adam then got serious and looked at me sizing me up. He said,
  “you aren't pressing or some psycho fan are you?” I could see in his face he
  was deadly serious. his body reflected it to his big muscles kind of pumped
  and he stood in a very aggressive way. I laughed as I said, “No I am not
  Press. Adam I know who you are, please don't take offense, but I really don't
  ever watch football or even know what team is from where.” smiling I said. “
  The only football game I ever watch is the Super Bowl and normally only just
  the commercials.” it took a second but after I said that to Adam then with a
  big smile on his face said, “really? no shit? Wow, do you just not like the
  game or what?” I wasn’t exactly sure what the answer I should give him should
  be. I decided hell I’ll just tell him the truth. I said to Adam. “ Do you want
  to know why I never got into football? Adam was intrigued; he probably
  expected a simple answer; he said, “Sure, now you have me curious.”\r

  \  \r

  \r

  I walked over to where the free weights are. He's sitting on one weight bench
  and I sit on the one next to it. The first thing I say to him is. “Adam I am a
  gay man just so you know, ok?” he replied, “Really you gay? You do not look
  gay.” I began my story.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  My home town expected me to try out for football. I was much smaller and
  younger, I skipped ahead a grade in school. I showed up I had to do it because
  I was suspected of being gay.\r

  \r

  \r

  Coach got directly in front of me. I thought he would step on my toes. I came
  up to the middle of his chest. He yelled you think you could stop me from
  passing you? Everyone started to laugh. I looked up at him and said, “maybe
  with a two-by-four board or sledgehammer” I saw the hate coming from the
  coach's eyes. I stared right back at him. The coach said, “You are too small
  and just try next year.” to tell you the truth I was relieved. but all the
  players took it that I was gay. They harassed and teased me all the time. Adam
  was watching me and I could tell he was thinking about what I was saying and
  was interested. Adam said, “Man that sucks” I continued my story with. “Three
  senior players made me blow them in the shower while several watched me.” Adam
  said, “Is that why you are gay?” I said, “no I like men before that. It was
  the degradation in public that messed with me.” Adam‘s face lit up as he
  understood what I told him. The mood was getting a bit serious so I changed
  the subject. I asked, “What's your life like being an icon for the NFL and so
  famous?” We sat and talked for over an hour. The phone rang two or three times
  and Adam says. “Fuck this phone, I am having a great time talking to you.” he
  powered off the phone and we continued to talk.\r

  Adam asked me to spot him why he lifted weights. All the time we had been
  talking he had a T-shirt on. He took it off and then lay down on the weight
  bench. I told him that I would spot him but not to push it because he had a
  lot of weight on that bar. I remember clearly the day as I am standing looking
  down at his face and nude chest as his muscles ripple with each press of
  weight. I couldn’t help myself so I looked down at his body over his big chest
  muscles, his washboard rippled stomach and I saw a huge mound of Cock showing
  through his gym shorts and his sexy legs spread wide. I glanced at the mirror
  on the opposing wall and I saw the view of him lifting me standing over him. I
  noticed I could see his balls through The leg opening of his shorts. my Cock
  was starting to get hard.\r

  I hear that bar clank into its holsters of the support over the bench. I
  looked down and I saw Adam with a huge smile on his face looking up at my now
  rather hard mound in my gym shorts. immediately I apologize and say it was
  just too hot of a view. He says, “ I always get a little bit of a stuffy when
  I’m pumping weights.” My jaw drops! I will see his hand move slowly from his
  chest over his rippled washboard stomach and reach down into his gym shorts
  and he grabs his Cock. I look back at his face and he has a sly grin. Adam
  said, “You want to see it?” I didn’t say anything but I’m sure the look on my
  face told him I did. He pulled out his pretty good size Cock and jiggled it.
  It stood straight up. He did that for a while and then he slipped it back in
  his gym shorts. A little bit later I’m bending over to pick up a bottle of
  water and I feel his hard Cock through his shorts pushed up against my ass.
  Adam said, “ it turns me on seeing you get excited looking at me. go sit on
  the weight bench” he let me suck him just a little bit but mostly he put on a
  huge show beating his meat and spayed over my face.\r

  I know you’re probably hoping for more but that’s all that happened but that
  was more than enough it’s one of my hottest Encounters with the least amount
  of sex.\r

  Sex time and you want to bottom for a guy. I remember when I first learned
  that gay guys had anal sex, it scared the shit out of me literally. My biggest
  concuntilern was, doesn't it get messy? I didn't even think about the pain  a
  while later. It was also a taboo topic. So I definitely couldn't ask anybody,
  especially while I was still in the closet.\r

  First you need to know how to clean up and take insertion with minimal pain. I
  went looking online for more information about anal sex, and I found this
  horror story. By the end of the story, there was poop and puke, and blood
  flying all over the room. The story freaked me out. It made me scared of anal
  sex for a long time. \r

  Cleanliness. As food is digested and travels through your digestive tract, it
  eventually winds up in your colon. And this is at the very end of the process.
  And basically, the colon's job is to suck as much water out of your digested
  food as possible to be recycled and used elsewhere in your body.\r

  When the colon has sucked as much water as it can from digested food that
  moves and is now poop inside your rectum, the rectum is essential because it's
  the field of play when you're having anal sex. The rectum is a long,
  expandable tube designed to hold poop and then smoothly pass it out of your
  body into your toilet. Your poop should be one solid, mostly dry mass that
  passes cleanly through the rectum, through the anus and into your bathroom.
  And the rectum is self-lubricated, which means there shouldn't be any pieces
  left behind. The anus is not so lubricated. It's mostly skin and muscles. So
  you'll still want to clean that area up. Take a quick shower and make sure
  that your anus is clean. You should be good to go if you took a poop recently.
  Combining a healthy diet and taking a fiber supplement every day helps keep
  good to go. As far as anal sex is concerned. You know, you always need a
  shower to clean up the area and make sure you're clean down there. I know that
  conditions aren't often ideal. Sometimes you need to clean up, and for that,
  they have what they call an anal douche. It's designed to squirt water up
  through your anus into your rectum to clean out any particles hanging around
  there. It's straightforward.\r

  You squirt it up there, hold it and then release it, and do this two or three
  times till the water runs clear, and then you should be good to go. They also
  have shower attachments that work very similarly, with a constant stream of
  water from your shower. \r

  You can get a Fleet enema from your local pharmacy. My best tips for cleaning
  are to use lukewarm water, nothing too hot, nothing too cold. Please don't use
  it too much, only half to three-quarters of a cup is all you need.\r

  You'll still want to fill the whole container because you don't want to be
  squirting air up inside yourself. Then I like to fill up the stem too because
  it can hold some air that you again don't want to squirt up when you're
  cleaning out. So fill the container, fill the stem. make sure to apply lots of
  lube to the tip and some to your anus. You can do it in the shower. In the
  shower, you clean up the area with some soap and water before engaging in any
  activity. There's still a chance that there will be some poop up there that
  winds up on your partner's dick. If it happens, it is important not to freak
  out; you know, it happens to everyone. Both of you go jump in the shower,
  clean up, and then finish your activities. If your top, Don't make your bottom
  feel bad. It's just something that's going to happen.\r

  The second most prominent question is, how do I take a big cock in my ass.
  Honestly, I'm super tight. I can't ever get anything in there without work. \r

  The first, as a bottom; you are in control. And I know this sounds
  counterintuitive to the traditional top-bottom dynamic. Still, the bottom
  needs to be in power at the beginning of the sexual encounter when he first
  gets comfortable with that insertion.\r

  Let's quickly go back to anatomy for a second because the anus is made up of
  two muscle groups, the internal sphincter muscles and the external sphincter
  muscles. The external forces are the ones you can control by clenching and
  releasing. These are the easiest to relax, but you still may need some focus
  to calm them because your first instinct, especially when something is going
  up there, is to clench, especially when there's pain that you want to grasp.
  It's just the body's natural reaction. So you must be conscious of it and tell
  your body to relax as you go through this process.\r

  Inside the anus are the internal sphincter muscles. And those are a series of
  ring muscles that open. These muscles can't control their involuntary muscles,
  so they need to be coaxed into relaxing and opening up. And The coaxing
  process can be a bit painful at first, so it's essential to approach it with
  lots of patience and lube. You know, and really, the process starts with
  foreplay. Foreplay is designed to get the area used to being touched and, you
  know, to relax and open up for the eventual insertion play can begin with just
  rubbing the outside of the anus with some lubed-up fingers. You can lick it
  directly if you want to or get a toy involved. Fingers are sometimes okay with
  clean hands, and the fingernails are cut very short.\r

  ________________\r

  Let's talk about how to start this process using a small toy. Start with a toy
  about a width that's no bigger than the width of your thumb. So it's not too
  small that it doesn't really do anything but not too big that you really can't
  get it the first time. Put lots of lube on both the toy and your anus. And
  slowly insert that toy and push it in until it becomes uncomfortable and
  painful. And just let it sit there for a second and hold it, and the bottom
  should try and relax. And this is the most challenging part because this
  process can often hurt. And your first instinct when you feel pain is to
  clench up. You have to keep that in mind and tell your body to relax and allow
  this to happen. So, you push it in until it's starting to get uncomfortable.
  Let it sit there for a few seconds, and tell your body to relax and get used
  to that sensation. And then pull the toy out, and then relax again, and sort
  of settle down. And then repeat the process. So again, lots of lube on both
  the toy and the anus. Insert it again until it starts getting uncomfortable
  and a little painful. Hopefully, you will get a little farther the next
  time.\r

  Again, let it sit there; try and relax your body. Try and get used to that
  sensation and then pull it out again, and sort of repeat this process until
  you can get that toy in without it being super uncomfortable. Now, this could
  take five times. It could take ten times, depending on how new you are to the
  process and how tolerant you are of the pain trying to get this working. But
  the point is you should keep going and doing this insert and removal process
  until the bottom is comfortable. Without insertion and they can take it
  without pain. And then, after lots of warm-up with the toy, if you're ready to
  move on to an actual penis, the process is very much the same\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  I think this is a good time for a quick side topic about dick size because
  When it comes to dick and anal sex, bigger isn't necessarily always better.
  Think about it this way; there are two types of pleasure triggers for the
  bottom during anal sex. First, there is the cluster of nerves that is, you
  know, clustered around your anus and throughout your rectum. And then there's
  the prostate, which is what they call the male pee spot. The prostate feels
  excellent to be massaged, especially when you're erect. And that can enhance
  an orgasm if it's a message during the middle of an orgasm. But the thing
  about the prostate is, it's not very far up in there, you know, if you look at
  this image of anatomy, you can reach the prostate pretty easily with a finger.
  So you don't need a huge dick to get that pleasure sensation from your pee
  spot. Now, I'm not saying big cocks are nasty because big dicks can feel good.
  After all, you do have all the added sense of the nerves throughout the rectum
  that you're playing with. And also, a lot of guys think that sort of filled-up
  feeling that they get from anal sex and a big dick. But again, everybody is
  different. Everything feels foreign to each body. So it's always important to
  experiment around with different sizes and different shapes and see what you
  like best. If a dick is too big, it actually can slam up against the back wall
  of the rectum, and that can be pretty uncomfortable. So again, bigger isn't
  necessarily always better. As you can tell from my stories, I like more
  oversized cocks. \r

  If you're a fan of porn, you've no doubt heard of a Sex Machine and have
  probably seen one in action but maybe you've never actually considered using a
  sex machine yourself? Or maybe you have no idea what a sex machine is but now
  we've got your curiosity piqued? Well let's have a chat about this shall we?
  While these sex machines might not fit neatly away in your nightstand like
  some of your other favorite sex toys, they will make up for this lack of
  compactness in their power, versatility and functionality.\r

  I personally don't use any machine assisted sex. I do however, as a top, use
  toys on a bottom. I have advanced skills with my fist too. Young I bottomed by
  choice and not by choice. I definitely am all top not that I'm in my latter
  years. And really since I was 35 I haven't bottomed and rarely perform oral.
  That said I mostly when wanting sex I just want to get blown and on occasion
  top a sexy man. \r

  When I was a bottom I did not seek to be penetrated but more forced to be
  bottom, with me trying to get away and then forced to submit, it's the
  surrender that I find hot. I also enjoyed performing oral then too. I still
  every so often desire oral but much prefer a submissive but manly guy
  swallowing me, several times too. \r

  The Best Gay Sex Tip for “Bottoms”\r

  As the receiver of sexual penetration, the bottom has a lot of power to
  control the direction of the sexual experience. Take advantage and channel
  your energies into making your top feel like a champion.\r

  \r

  \r

  2. Be an Active Participant in the Sexual Encounter & Send Him Over the Edge\r

  One of the common complaints I hear from tops in my therapy and coaching
  practice is they find it boring and annoying when their bottom “just lays
  there” and “expects me to do all the work.” While for some part of the joy of
  being a bottom is the passivity inherent in the role, you also play an
  important part in the experience.\r

  \r

  \r

  Keep in mind it’s a lot of pressure for the top, as the penetrator, to be able
  to establish and maintain a solid erection for the festivities ahead, so it’s
  essential that you play your part to the hilt so he doesn’t feel like the sole
  provider for the pleasure to come.\r

  \r

  \r

  Take the lead in the foreplay activities, tease him with your body, your
  caresses, and your oral skills, and edge him by masturbating him to the brink
  of climax, and then retreat before repeating the exercise again. Work him up
  into such a frenzy that he can’t wait to throw you back on the bed and get
  busy. Through your active contributions to the sex play, you’ll be helping to
  feed his turn-on, which will only serve your best interests by keeping the
  sexual encounter lasting longer and more frenetic.\r

  When I look back, my encounter below is my favorite to remember.\r

  \r

  \r

  My air conditioning was out, and my window was open.  It was boiling in the
  summer heat. I was naked, sweaty, sleeping in my bed covered by a sheet.  I
  woke up late at night, hearing a noise.  Standing right next to me, I see in
  the dim moonlight an oversized silhouette.  Barely awake, I looked\r

  \r

  \r

  to him before but had spoken to his wife a few times.  \r

  Now fully awake, I realize I am soaked with sweat and have no sheet over me.
  Nude, I became nervous. Then his smell on the hot breeze was so sexy, and he
  smelled of musk and sweaty man. He was so close to me. I looked over at
  him—what a view. Inches from my face, he stood. His jeans were bulging, and he
  was shirtless. His washboard stomach was glistening in the moonlight. I
  couldn't help but notice a thin line of hair running up over his ripped
  body.  My eyes moved up, following that sexy line. I gasped when his big chest
  flexed, showing off his perfectly covered hairy muscles.  \r

  \ I wondered why he was in my house as I made eye contact. \"I saw your air
  conditioner was out, and your window never opened, but it was tonight. I was
  checking to see if you are ok with people dying in this heat.  You didn't wake
  up after I shouted through the window.\". I replied oh yes, thanks; it's hot
  for sure.  He noticed that I was naked and wet. The sheet was on the floor. He
  picked it up, and as he gave me the sheet, he paused, looking down at my naked
  body. He looked hard at my ass.  I was puzzled that he looked at my ass. He
  was a 6 ft 4 Burley stud. A construction worker redneck man.  His wife was
  beautiful, and he was very straight. Then I heard it, and his deep manly voice
  was so hot.  He says his wife divorced him and has been gone for over a
  month... \"She told me you are gay, and I have only been with girls, so I
  don't know how to say this.\". He puffed up, flexing like showing off. It was
  so sexy and cute too.  \"Hell, I want you to suck me off. I am so horny.\" He
  held my head with my hair. His hands held my head.  His jeans flew open, and
  my face was filled with his massive meat...We had fun several times. \r

  He was more straight than anything. He liked doing chores for me, like taking
  care of my pool and fixing things. His treatment of me was remarkable. He
  wanted to treat me like his girlfriend in many ways. I miss him because he was
  the \"Man around the house\" to me, and for years, I have been the \"Man of
  the house.\"\r

  Straight men and Gay Sex.\r

  If you are a gay man, you need to handle your straight encounters correctly.
  For some reason, I have no earthly idea why But, 80% of all my encounters were
  with straight men. I'm here to tell you nothing will ever happen unless you
  act confidently. When something does happen, it's not going to be like a gay
  story fantasy where the dude decides to put it out. It does happen, but
  rarely. Instead, you've got to be the one in charge. That process begins by
  showing confidence. And like it or not, that means carrying yourself in a
  manly way. If you ever want to have an encounter with a straight guy, you need
  to think as he does. I'm not saying you should pretend to be straightforward,
  but instead, be aware of his mindset. Don't hide that you are gay. One of the
  worst pieces of advice that people give when it comes to seducing a straight
  guy is to be ambiguous about sexual orientation. I'm going to cut through all
  of the BS. When the time is right, you will know along the way, and he will
  give you essential signals. These include laughing at your jokes, asking you
  questions, personal questions, and occasionally doing some male bonding
  touching.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  Avoid making him feel gay. Most straight guys are happy to bust a nut. Some
  are curious about what it might be like with another man. But the last thing
  they want is to think what they are doing is gay. We can argue until the cows
  come home about what constitutes gay, straight, or bi. But that's not the
  point. The goal is to connect with him down the road. If he comes back for
  more, you can do more. But that first time, it's best to get down to business.
  If you have done things right, he will get you off you in the future. That
  only happens when he trusts you. Okay, I need to clarify some things. First, I
  have only twice purposely initiated an encounter with a man I knew was
  straight. I behave very similarly to straight guys. I don't look feminine, and
  I look manly. My voice is deep. My body is more petite and looks cute. The
  second thing I need to clarify. \r

  The truth is the biggest reason that a straight guy comes around is he knows
  that you can do an incredible job of getting him off. Don't be the first one
  to reach out. Instead, let him be the one to do it. He is the one who needs to
  make contact. Kissing. I need to stress this. A part of you badly wants to
  make out with him. But you're not sure. Please don't do it unless he makes a
  move in that direction. He starts to think it's getting emotional. He's going
  to split based on experience. Youtube you that you'll have to go through a
  period where all he wants is quick service. Be open to that.\r

  But at some point, he'll be curious about what it's like to do more. How and
  what happens next depends on the guy. I've met straight but interested men who
  are all about reciprocation. I've met others who want to penetrate. And I've
  even met dudes who want to feel what it's like to get banged out. Don't fall
  in love. I cannot stress this enough. Yes, this is easier said than done.
  You're going to feel a bunch of emotions. You will even be tempted to think of
  him in boyfriend terms. Whatever you do, don't. Regardless of your opinion, it
  would be best to recognize that he considers himself straight. We both know
  that the minute he started messing around, his heterosexuality went out the
  window. But that's not an argument you want to have with him. Instead,
  remember, your connection with him is physical. And it can be that way for a
  long time. But if you try to make him into your lover, he will run away.\r

  There are plenty of gay men out there that want to husband up. Go for those
  guys. Straight is sex a tiny bit more. That's all it is. Think of the straight
  man you are doing as just that straight guy you get off. Not a couple. You can
  have fun with a straight man. But keep your perspective honest and accurate.
  You can have even better friendships. Also, it would be best if they always
  Respect  their feelings. \r

  \r

  Sex and fantasy are often hard to discuss. Knowing how things are defined is
  useful:\r

  \ \r

  BDSM is a general umbrella term for a variety of erotic and psychological
  practices and or roleplaying; it is an acronym representing three
  components:\r

  * BD: Bondage & Discipline (playing with physical restraints, training,
  punishment, etc.)\r

  * DS: Dominance & Submission (playing with obedience, power exchange, service,
  humility, etc.)\r

  * SM: Sadism & Masochism (playing with pain, degradation, fear, etc.)\r

  More often than not, other 'deviant' sexual practices are also part of BDSM.\r

  BDSM is a consensual activity respecting the fundamental rights of every human
  being involved; this separates it from sexual and domestic abuse.\r

  \r

  \r

  BDSM Archetypes\r

  Everyone is different, and finding two kinksters with the same preferences is
  probably impossible. There are, however, a few common 'archetypes' that people
  can identify with to varying degrees (from 0% to 100%). Curious to what extent
  each archetype suits you? Take the test! The list below is to complete, but it
  should cover the most common ones.\r

  \r

  \r

  Dominant\r

  Dominants like to be in charge. Some want to have their partner obey them
  without questioning; others like some resistance while taking it their way.
  Some are dominant only in the bedroom; others dominate their daily lives.
  Unlike the top roles (giving pain/bondage/degradation), being dominant is more
  about who decides what happens (and takes the responsibility that comes with
  it) than the contents of what happens.\r

  \r

  \r

  Submissive\r

  Submissives like to follow. Some want to give the control away to their
  partner(s), and some like to have it forcibly taken from them. Some are
  submissive only in the bedroom; others are submissive throughout their daily
  lives (usually with limitations). Unlike the bottom roles (receiving
  pain/bondage/degradation), being submissive is more about who decides what
  happens (and takes the responsibility that comes with it) than about the
  contents of what happens.\r

  \r

  \r

  Sadist\r

  Sadists enjoy inflicting (certain types of) pain on their partner(s), usually
  in a sexual context.\r

  \r

  \r

  Masochist\r

  Masochists enjoy receiving (certain types of) pain from their partner(s),
  usually in a sexual context. Masochism is independent of pain tolerance: it is
  purely about the ability to enjoy (or get aroused by) certain pain levels.\r

  \r

  \r

  Rigger\r

  Riggers like to tie up and restrain their partner(s) using rope and other
  attributes (chains, cuffs, spreader bars, etc.). Whether for sexual
  enhancement, art, or fun, they enjoy having their partners at their mercy.\r

  \r

  \r

  Rope bunny\r

  Rope bunny likes to be tied up and restrained, using rope and other attributes
  (chains, cuffs, spreader bars, etc.). Whether for sexual enhancement, art, or
  fun, they enjoy being totally at the mercy of their partner(s).\r

  \r

  \r

  Master/Mistress\r

  Masters/Mistresses receive complete control over the life of their slave(s)
  and all responsibilities that come with it. They go a step further than
  dominants because their power exchange is present 24/7 and in all aspects of
  their life (except for negotiated exceptions such as during their office
  jobs). Their primary focus is to create a stable and safe environment for
  their slave(s), to allow optimal servitude.\r

  \r

  \r

  Enslaved person\r

  Enslaved people completely hand over the control and responsibilities over
  their life to their enslaver/mistress. They go further than submissives
  because their power exchange is present 24/7 and in all aspects of their life
  (except for negotiated exceptions such as during their office jobs). Serving
  their master/mistress is their primary focus, and they rarely have limits for
  themselves.\r

  \r

  \r

  Degrader\r

  Degraders like to degrade and humiliate their play partner(s), either by
  acting upon them in a degrading way or by forcing them to do things they
  consider degrading.\r

  \r

  \r

  Degree \r

  Degrades like to be spoiled and humiliated by their play partner(s), either by
  being acted upon in a degrading way or by being forced to do things they
  consider degrading.\r

  \r

  \r

  Owner\r

  Owners own pets/properties and take responsibility for them on a 24/7 basis.
  Sexuality is not necessarily involved; in some cases, role-play attributes are
  also provided (e.g., a cage for the pet). There is no link between sex with
  animals (which is not on the BDSM spectrum), and many pets don't even feel
  like they're playing an animal; it's more about the typical relationship
  between an owner and a pet.\r

  \r

  \r

  Pet\r

  Pets are the property of their owner in daily life. Sexuality is not
  necessarily involved; in some cases, role-play attributes are also provided
  (e.g., a cage for the pet). There is no link between sex with animals (which
  is not on the BDSM spectrum), and many pets don't even feel like they're
  playing an animal; it's more about the typical relationship between an owner
  and a pet.\r

  \r

  \r

  Brat tamer\r

  Brat tamers are, in essence, dominants who enjoy handling bratty submissives.
  They find disobedience a form of playfulness from the side of the submissive
  rather than a form of rudeness. They will take no offense to it but will still
  teach the sub a well-deserved lesson (because, of course, that is why the
  bratty sub shows such behavior in the first place).\r

  \r

  \r

  Brat\r

  Brats are, in essence, naughty submissives. They find disobedience a form of
  playfulness rather than letting their dominant down and require a compatible
  dominant who will not only teach them a lesson but also accept that any number
  of lessons might still not necessarily change this behavior.\r

  \r

  \r

  Primal (Hunter)\r

  Primals are mainly focused on their instincts, and they enjoy letting their
  inner animal out during sex. The crucial part of the first play is that the
  participants show their raw, emotional, and sexual feelings during play. All
  the labels, roles, and protocols go out the window, and the prey can become a
  snarling, growing, clawing animal hell-bent on getting away from its predator
  (you).\r

  \r

  \r

  Primal (Prey)\r

  Primals are mainly focused on their instincts, and they enjoy letting their
  inner animal out during sex. The crucial part of the first play is that the
  participants show their raw, emotional, and sexual feelings during play. All
  the labels, roles, and protocols go out the window, and the prey (you) can
  become a snarling, growing, clawing animal hell-bent on getting away from its
  predator.\r

  \r

  \r

  Daddy/Mommy\r

  Daddies/Mommies take on a caretaker role in the relationship, being a guide as
  much as a dominant. Daddies/Mommies dominate their little treasure submissives
  with an iron fist in a velvet glove: much cuddly and affectionate on the
  outside while being as sturdy and rigid as other dominants. Using subtle
  psychological mechanisms rather than brute power, they nurture their littles
  into obedience. Sexuality is not necessarily involved, and there is no link
  with pedophilia (which is not on the BDSM spectrum).\r

  \r

  \r

  Boy/Girl\r

  Littles (girls/boys) are submissive spirits with a strong flavor of childlike
  innocence. They long for a nurturing, loving dominant who plays a guiding,
  almost parental role in their lives. While they require a softer approach to
  be dominated than most other submissives, their submission can be just as deep
  as that of other submissives or enslaved people. Sexuality is not necessarily
  involved, and there is no link with pedophilia (which is not on the BDSM
  spectrum).\r

  \r

  \r

  Ageplay\r

  Age players like to play with age as part of their kink. They typically take
  on a much younger or older generation than they are or prefer playing with a
  partner that does so. Attributes and behavior changes (such as pacifiers,
  coloring books, speaking in a more childlike language, etc.) are commonly
  paired to enrich the context and make it more appropriate for the playing age.
  Sexuality is not necessarily involved, and there is no link with pedophilia
  (which is not on the BDSM spectrum).\r

  \r

  \r

  Exhibitionist\r

  Exhibitionists enjoy showing their naked bodies or sexual activity to other
  people. Consensually, of course.\r

  \r

  \r

  Voyeur\r

  Voyeurs enjoy watching the nakedness or sexual activity of other people.
  Consensually, of course.\r

  \r

  \r

  Experimentalist\r

  Experimentalists want to have tried it all. An open mind and an insatiable
  curiosity are their key features, and they rarely form an opinion before
  gathering first-hand experience. They often have plenty of fantasies and will
  actively pursue trying them out.\r

  \r

  \r

  Non-monogamist\r

  Non-monogamists do not see sexuality as necessarily a one-on-one thing.
  Whether this means they will have several relationships or see other people
  outside their relationship (or have even more exquisite constructions) depends
  entirely on the person and the situation. Still, they all have one thing in
  common: their sexuality is more than just between them and one fixed
  partner.\r

  \r

  \r

  Switch\r

  Switches like to... well, switch. Taking a dominant or top position is not for
  them; neither is always taking a submissive or \r

  bottom role. Some prefer to exchange with the same partner or partners, and
  others have a dominant play partner and a submissive play partner, but in
  either case, they do not fit on one endpoint of the spectrum.\r

  \r

  \r

  Vanilla\r

  Vanilla people enjoy regular, standard sex and relationship models. Nothing
  wrong with that, as long as you're having fun. \r

  Now I will tell you some of the situations and encounters I experienced with
  men.\r

  \r

  \r

  It was a male stripper company. Not a trashy prostitute-type business but
  quality shows and tours.\r

  \ \r

  It all began with 13 inches. I was working as a daytime bartender at happy
  hour. I loved my part-time bartender job. I had never been a bartender before,
  and I got good at it. The bar was getting a large afternoon crowd, and even
  some famous people would pop in to chat during their lunch hour. The bar
  always had a stripper on a box with the light above them jiggling for two
  hours. At nighttime on Thursday, they put on what they called \"The Show.\" A
  song played, a guy would walk out the stage, then stripped, and that was it. I
  was a happy hour bartender, so I never saw the shows until I was asked to work
  a night shift. They needed an additional bartender. I agreed.\r

  \   \r

  I knew a lot about costumes and performances. I have been in ballet and
  off-Broadway shows. I learned how to dance. Thursday night shift, the
  customers were delighted to see me there at night. I’m watching the stripper
  show. The guys were all cute, but they didn’t know how to dance. There was
  nothing special about the show at all. The bar closed, and I was talking to
  the owner. He knew I was a professional dancer and asked me what I thought. I
  asked him, \"Is all that ever happens in the shows?\". The bar owner said,
  \"Yes,\" and continued to tell me that it was costly and the company always
  sends the same performers. I asked him how much he paid, and he told me.
  \"What?\" I exclaimed after hearing the amount he was paying per dancer.\r

  \ \r

  The following Thursday, one of the dancers was visible to me from my
  workstation. Let’s call him Rico. He was standing on the box with the light
  above his head. He was very sexy at six feet tall with all the proper bumps,
  shapes, and portions. Sexy in all the right places. I liked watching him
  gyrating and jiggling to the music. He danced pretty well. I noticed that his
  T-Back was extremely big. His cock was huge. When I took my break, I decided
  to talk to Rico. I bought a couple of dollars and talked to him while adding
  dollars to his T-Back. Rico bent down and whispered into my ear, \"Look
  down.\" I looked down, and he had pulled the top of the T-Back open. AInside I
  saw his vast 13 inches, the biggest I had ever seen.\r

  \ \r

  I found out that he was not given but only a quarter of the money paid for him
  in the booking fee—also, 20% of the tips he had to give to his agent. By the
  way, Rico liked me, and he was flirting with me heavily. So I slipped him my
  phone number.\r

  \ \r

  Rico called me one day out of the blue. We had a great conversation on the
  phone, and he asked me if I would mind him coming over. Of course, I said,
  \"Sure.\"\r

  \ \r

  We are sitting in my living room, talking on the couch, all about his stripper
  career and the company he works for. He mentions that many other performers
  are pissed off because they’re paying ridiculous amounts of money and not
  getting that many jobs. My egg head started working. At that moment, I
  realized that all I needed to have was several performers, and I could train
  them how to dance and put on a fantastic show.\r

  \ \r

  I didn’t say anything to Rico then because I was more interested in getting
  him in bed. Rico says as he stands up, let me put on a show for you! He strips
  for me to end up completely nude. Rico gives it to me as he looks at me. He
  had smooth skin, no hair, and a washboard stomach, and that enormous Cock was
  fun.\r

  \ \r

  A couple of weeks later, I talked to the bar's owner. He gave me the names of
  all the other bars that use the agent. I began calling. I asked them if I
  could get the price down by 25% and put on shows with choreography backdrops
  and themes they would be interested in. All but one said yes!\r

  \ \r

  I Was allowed to use my bar for rehearsals. I ran an ad in the gay newspaper
  asking for performers. Rico brought ten guys that worked for the old company.
  It was a nightmare trying to teach these gorgeous men to dance. Some of them
  were just too bad to train. Finally, word got out to the bars that I was doing
  this and had rehearsals.\r

  \ \r

  For our first show, I had a giant backdrop painted with phosphorus paint that
  would glow in black lights. Three guys danced on the stage simultaneously,
  interacting with each other. They were in white unitards painted with the same
  phosphorus paint. It was a cute little number. The lights were all normal
  until they began to strip their unitards underneath. They were skin-tight, and
  as they undressed, the black lights were turned on. All you saw were the
  glowing unitards painted. We had several other sets, a country-western theme
  and a leather theme. Next week's show was huge! Soon the bar had to have three
  showings. It was packed and had a waiting line around the block. All to see my
  shows. I know it sounds great. Hot, right? Well, it was sweltering, but it had
  a severe problem. It's called my ethics. I knew better than to screw around
  with my dancers. And for the most part, I stuck to my rule. I dated two of my
  dancers for a very, very long time. It was more of a relationship than
  screwing around, but I never just had sex with the dancers. I could have too
  many times. Looking back, I probably would have made a different decision and
  enjoyed myself.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \  \r

  \r

  As I mentioned, it started with 13 inches, and honestly, Rico was married. His
  wife and kids were fantastic, and we got along well. I will skip ahead by
  mentioning Rico was my \"boyfriend\" for many years. I tell you because he
  helped me run my business too.\r

  Well, because our shows were incredible and the dancers were well-trained, and
  we were only doing quality stuff in the best nightclubs around the country, I
  was very good at organizing the business and keeping it operational. It
  boomed. We were everywhere.\r

  After many years of operation, my business ended because of carjacking and not
  having significant insurance.\r

  Because of the carjacking and my being shot dead, I came back, and I took
  months to recover. I had to sell my business and Texas home. I was broke.\r

  Let me rewind time and tell you that I didn't mess around much. I dated Rico,
  and everyone considered him either a boss or my boyfriend. \r

  Bar and Club Tips \r

  My generation was raised really talking to people. And the bars were a safe
  place to hook up, make friends and other social news. In the late 80s it also
  became the place to discuss HIV & AIDS. Gay bars were instrumental in Raising
  money to help those in need. Fortunately I knew enough to play safe. It was
  extremely hard to see 100s of such a close community die. I had to stop going
  to funerals. With covid younger people might be able to understand how bad it
  was then. For a long time nobody knew anything and people were dropping like
  flies for no reason, and of course you had on top of that the religious
  zealots saying that we were being damned to hell, but like all diseases it did
  not stay in our group.  As females and straight men began to get sick that
  changed. It was so bad gays had to travel In groups to not get beaten and
  often killed. I had 2 really close friends. One got AIDS the other got KKKed
  helping a sick guy to his car. I will say that COVID fatal rate is microscopic
  in comparison. One good thing living through all that was the Gay community
  stood up and demanded a semblance of respect and the antiviral meds today were
  developed by our influence and efforts. Interestingly my Friend Shawna Brooks
  introduced me to Elton John at a benefit concert in Atlanta. He told me about
  the CDC's findings. \r

  Luckily the younger gays do not have to worry about it. Pills with no real
  side effects keep the problem to the level of a minor problem. \r

  So you are I a club and \r

  No one talks to the person sulking in the corner. open up and smile. A person
  who is confident attracts other people. The exact people who you want to
  become friends with to be popular at the bar. If you feel unsure and are not
  really that confident, fake it 'till you make it.\r

  The first person you should talk to at the bar is the bouncer or the coat
  check person. Chat them up about anything, your best bet is complimenting them
  on their hair or clothes. The main reason behind this is that these are the
  people who see everything at the bar and know everyone. It also makes you more
  confident walking in knowing that you have a report with someone there.
  Bartenders are also good. Try to order the same thing all night, they will
  recognize you from that repetitive behavior.\r

  The truth is that dating as a gay, bi+, or pansexual man can be as messy,
  unfulfilling, and complicated as “Queer As Folk” makes it seem.\r

  But it doesn’t have to be.\r

  Most people will be nice and chat you up back. This is a great way to make
  friends and maybe even get a drink or two. Don’t worry about anyone's gender
  or sexual orientation, simply talk to someone. Remember to smile. \r

  The apps are great. Bars are better.\r

  Perhaps watching Queer as Folk when wasn’t the best gauge of accuracy for how
  venturing out onto the gay scene would be. In my mind, everyone would be
  eye-fucking each other until, with the nod of a head, you’d be off with
  someone and go and get head or have sex. \r

  \r

  \r

  Don’t take it too seriously\r

  Despite what TV dramas and romantic comedies might teach you, hooking up with
  that hot guy from the bar shouldn’t be a mission with every eventuality
  planned and plotted. It should be fun. It should be casual. And the end result
  shouldn’t be everything. The successes and the rejections are all part of
  it.\r

  Admittedly, before the advent of hookup apps, when I was a baby gay first on
  the scene, things were a little like that, just without the great lighting,
  flattering camera angles, and it wasn’t being broadcast on Showtime. Things
  nowadays are very different. Not only are gay bars and clubs in crisis,
  closing left, right, and center, but the art of hooking up has diminished.
  It’s easy to drop a pin at your location and wait for a guy to come over,
  right? Who’s got the time and money to drop $16 on a vodka soda and perch
  yourself in a bar while you attempt to make eyes at anyone you can?\r

  \r

  \r

  Well, the answer should be YOU; you should have the time because this historic
  method to hook up is way more thrilling and rewarding than a few taps on your
  smartphone while you lounge on your couch watching old episodes of Drag Race.
  So, put down your phone and follow this advice and you, too, could take that
  hot guy home from the bar.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  Use your eyes wisely and pay attention to details. \r

  Any guy in a gay bar can roam a room with their eyes, making contact with each
  Tom, Dick, and Harry in the place. That’s the easy part. The complicated
  element of cruising like this is realizing, first, when to pack it in once
  you’ve scored, and second, how to use it sparingly.\r

  \r

  \r

  The  temptation can be to seek out anyone who flings a glance your way and to
  try and play a game of who blinks first. Be leisurely about it; there’s no
  reason to rush into something. Note that it’s sexy to be coy, but don’t
  prolong things. If it appears you’re both into it, for goodness sake, go over
  and introduce yourself to them. Be wary, too, of searching around like a
  meerkat. It’s better to go home alone than to get into something you don’t
  want to get into.\r

  Many bars have a drag night, find out when it is and go. If the bar has a
  resident Drag Queen she will most likely be hosting the night, after the show
  go up and introduce yourself while telling her that you liked the show. Be
  careful though most Queens have claws. Don't hang with her the whole night,
  say you liked the show, maybe buy her a drink and then leave and do your own
  thing.\r

  We live in an age when people are more and more afraid to talk to strangers.
  It’s why the apps are so damn popular. But don’t be scared to initiate
  conversation with someone who catches your eye. You could end up having a
  glorious evening discussing your favorite books before you head back to your
  place and fool around. In fact, the worst that can happen is that someone
  gives you an odd look (it happens) or tells you that they’re not interested in
  chatting. If that’s the case, don’t be a dick about it; just walk away and
  find somewhere else to go. Conversation, however, is key.\r

  Tip: the guy you want the most in a bar looks at him. If he looks a little
  interested, play like you think oh he's nice but not overly interested. People
  always want what they can't have or it is difficult to get you to become much
  more attractive if you don't throw yourself at somebody. \r

  Next are more interesting sexual encounters \r

  \r

  \r

  I was driving across the country on the highway in a truck with sets and gear
  for a booking. A husband and wife in a convertible pull alongside and start
  showing off for me. He pulls out his meat and fingers her. Happenspens
  sometimes on the highway, and they usually speed off after a short distance,
  but they follow me for a long time.\r

  I pulled into a rest area and was in the bathroom stall. The bathroom was
  hectic, and my door opened. In steps the guy as he shut the stall door. He
  told me to go be quiet as he pulled out his meat... long story short. All
  three of us got a hotel, which was probably the hottest sexual experience I
  ever had. Oh, FYI, no, I didn't have intercourse with the girl. Well, not the
  Full thing, that is.\r

  ________________\r

  \ \r

  Driving not far from Denver, Colorado, my car broke down, and it was snowing
  and freezing. After many hours I was freezing, and there was a tap on my
  window. It was a tow truck. The tow truck driver was a big burly man, and he
  was very concerned when he found me. I was shivering so much I couldn't speak.
  He put me in the cab of his tow truck and hooked up my car. The roads were so
  bad the snow was coming down awfully. I was dozing in and out, shivering until
  I blacked out.\r

  I woke up and was wrapped in blankets on a couch. Looking around, I could tell
  I was in a trailer. I saw in a recliner the tow truck driver sleeping. I was
  naked and bundled up, so I could not get out of the blankets. I checked out
  Rex, the truck driver. He was a big guy, not fat but big, with a reddish beard
  and tattoos. A suitable ol' boy type divorced at about 40. He was in a
  T-shirt, boots, and jeans showing a large silver belt buckle. He was sexy as
  hell, daddy type sleeping near me. I dozed off to sleep again to wake up
  hearing the shower running.\r

  Rex comes into the room in a towel. His body showed muscles and his tattoos
  were super high quality. I hear. \"I am glad you're ok.\" Rex had a voice that
  was so manly yet kind.\r

  We talked about my frostbite, and his nurse ex-wife would check on me
  tomorrow, car repair, etc. All this time, he has a towel on his chair. I see
  it hanging under the towel easily. He was big, and everything was. It looked
  like two baseballs, and draped over them was one of those sausages from
  hickory farms. My eyes must have shown my impressive obsession. Rex said,
  \"You are gay, aren't you? That's cool. I had a buddy in jail\" I bet you
  think he wanted me to blow him. Yes, he did. I bet you think he wanted me to
  bend over for him. No, I was amazed and happy because you may not believe it,
  but only straight guys did I turn for. I was delighted because rarely do I
  find this masculine of a bottom.\r

  We had lots of fun and not only sex. We enjoyed talking and had many common
  interests. I saw him a couple of times, once at the white party in the keys
  and once we arranged to meet in Aspen.\r

  It's funny, and it's challenging to mention many of the things that happened
  while I was touring with the dancers or booking them in the bars because I met
  everybody famous people, bar owners leaders in the industry, so most of my
  experience was not sexual during keyhole production studios.\r

  Please don't get disheartened. I'm going to share a few more things that
  happened, and believe me, some things were spectacular.\r

  ________________\r

  \ \r

  I saw a lot of sex on tour because we shared hotel rooms. A typical time had
  five performers. We would try to get as few rooms as possible to save money—a
  minimum of 2 to a room and often three we did. On occasion, we all stayed in
  one room. \"Woof\" I must admit it was hard not to get gang banged. The guys
  knew It too. They would lay around nude and tease me all the time—a few hit on
  me for real.\r

  So my one New Year Show on tour happened. 6 of us were in a nice hotel out of
  town. This was a top-rated high, billing booking. They were paying top dollar
  for a New Year's Eve show. The guys made many tips, so everybody was excited
  and happy and a little drunk, so we all finally got to the hotel after a great
  show.\r

  Rico was running things elsewhere, so he wasn't on tour with me. I was with 2
  Viking-looking guys, one biker daddy, a construction worker, and a jock
  type—big sweaty hot guys and two beds. I sat in the chair, and the guys were
  milling around the room. All of a sudden, I noticed everybody was naked. I
  didn't pay much attention until I saw everyone standing close to my chair.\r

  \ \r

  They took my clothes off. I told them I was taken. I told them I was the boss
  and it was not cool. I told them Rico would find out. That's when they started
  laughing and told me. \"Rico told them to do it. He said to the guys, \" After
  all these years, he has been astounding. Other booking and production
  companies charge more, plus you have to do whatever sexual favor too. I want
  him to have this fantasy he told me he has come true. \"\r

  Guys, you best darn well believe it did. Those guys took it and gave it and
  everything in between.\r

  During all of my keyhole business, I had a group of very affluent friends that
  lived in San Antonio, and often they would travel with me when we would tour
  or show up and help me by calling on the phone and telling me what was going
  on inside of a bar where my dancers would be booked at.\r

  On the beach in Texas. A pair of lovers that I knew before my business, during
  my company, and after my business. Yes, and to this very day, I live in
  Missouri and travel in an RV every year. After a show, we would go to the
  beach and use the RV and camp.\r

  A Touring pornstar I had booked in my show as a guest performer.\r

  The show went well, and we were all in the rather cramped RV. It was a kind of
  windy night but warm, so the pornstar and I decided we would go just for a
  walk along the beach.\r

  He talked about his career, complimented me on my shows, and liked my work. We
  got quite a far way from the RV, and there was a log, and he stopped. My eyes
  must have popped out because shortly after I heard his zipper open, he said.
  \"Yeah, I see you like it.\" Wagging his huge thing as pee shot from it. I'm
  not really into that kind of thing, but I must admit it was beautiful with the
  moonlight coming in over the ocean across his sexy body and colossal meat
  hanging there. I could see he was expecting me to go for him. I didn't, but
  instead, I pulled my dick out and peed. I wasn't expecting anything to happen,
  but I heard. \"Damn, you're pretty hung. I didn't expect that.\" I laughed and
  said, \"ok, please make your way bigger.\". Then he told me something I will
  never forget. \r

  \"Yeah, but you are beautiful. I can see you're in this business, but I also
  see how happy everyone around you is.\" Then he grabbed my cock, pulling me to
  him. I stood, eyes even with his chest. \"This is what you are going to do.
  First, make not a sound unless it's yes, sir. Understand me? He was in my
  face, one hand moving from my dick to my butt. His other hand pushed my head
  onto his washboard body until I choked on him. He swallowed me, and we played
  and slept on the beach till morning. Rico found out about this one and wasn't
  overly happy.\r

  I have always run across erotic guys.\r

  Performer Greg lived not very far from me and was a fabulous dancer. He had an
  adorable body, kind of a boy type. He was also kinky as hell! Greg knew my
  company policy was no sexual fraternization. He was a neighbor, so he would
  come over sometimes and use my pool and visit.\r

  One time he was over, and I needed to run to the store for something. He
  stayed at my house while I was gone. I arrived back from the store, and I
  couldn’t find him anywhere. The last place I went to look was my bedroom.\r

  I had one of those wrought iron canopy beds. Completely naked and handcuffed
  with one wrist to my bed. Greg lay on my bed. Next to him was a huge dildo. I
  said Greg, what the fuck are you doing? Greg smiled and said, I will only tell
  you where the key is after you use that dildo on me! I tried to convince him
  otherwise, but he would not tell me where the key was. I looked all around. I
  thought he may have hidden it. I even left him there like that for a few
  hours. That was a mistake that only made him hornier.\r

  Greg, you know I shouldn’t do this. I should fire you! I told him. Greg
  pleaded and begged. I need you to violate me and fuck me. I need you to use me
  as your whore. Please, sir, please! I just said. Shit! He was on my bed, and
  one arm stuck to the bedpost, coughed his face in the pillow, his butt in the
  air with his knees underneath him. He had a beautiful pink hole in the center
  of a firm, round butt. I never used sex toys until that very day. I grab the
  big dildo for grease and watch his pink whole separate. I slowly shoved that
  huge dildo inside him. Greg moaned and groaned in such an erotic way it turned
  me on, and my dick got hard. It was beautiful sightseeing this gorgeous guy
  with that huge dildo and that pretty stretch going in and out of it.\r

  Greg cries out, “fuck me, please, sir.” I removed the big dildo from him and
  got behind him. my palms spread his butt cheeks as I ram my Cock hard deep
  into his hole. I fucked him very hard, slapping his ass, pulling his hair,
  reaching around, and pinching his nipples as he screamed and moaned fuck me,
  Stud, give me that cum. I had never had such a restrained, submissive man in
  front of me. I feel my Cock swell, and He pushes back, wanting me deep inside.
  \r

  8 1/2 hours later, he finally gave me the key. He had thrown it across the
  room into my Fish Tank.\r

  Tom was the third stripper I had sex with. I was considering making it into my
  lover. He was ex-military. He was stripped part-time, and he was around after
  the keyhole production studio closed because of a carjacking. He visited me in
  the hospital, but I ended up moving away before anything developed of
  significance.\r

  Carjacking and Tom.\r

  Okay, so here is what happened. It was three o'clock, and I pulled into an
  Exxon gas station to get gas. The gas station I stopped at was dark but just
  off the highway. Long story short, I was shot in the neck while getting
  carjacked. I ended up in a military hospital. It wasn't good. I had to close
  my business because of it.\r

  ________________\r

  \ \r

  I was in a hospital ward with beautiful military patients everywhere. I had
  breathing tubes in my nose and neck, But other than that, I was not damaged.
  After about a week, I was able to move around a bit. I had a big machine to
  breathe to push around, but I could go short distances. Everybody there knew I
  was gay. Vast numbers of male and female dancers visited me. Plus, a few
  queens. Now I am lying in the ward of a bunch of masculine redneck military
  guys in Texas. I thought I would get hassled, and a few guys did, but mostly
  they were enjoying the flesh parade visiting me. No privacy here at all. \r

  One time three of my girls were there. It was funny too. As I looked, all eyes
  were on us. Every Cock was hard. I told the girls to look, and they smiled. I
  said. Girls. Look, these boys are stuck in here bored. The girls started to
  smile. They knew me well. Next, I said I bet all those men are horny Looking
  at my sexy girls. I know because I've been playing boners with these men in
  the room. All the men sat up in their beds if they could. The soldier's eyes
  were opened as big as saucers. I told one of the girls to get the nurse. I
  mean the male nurse that I want to have some privacy. Would he guard the door?
  He smiled and said, I can get in big trouble for this. Fucking it. I will
  watch the door. My girls went to bed. They danced. They sucked and fuck the
  room. The guys were in heaven. My view was fantastic, too.\r

  We got away with it, too, from then on. Those guys treated me awesomely. Late
  one night, about a week later. Tom was getting released the next day with a
  medical discharge. Tom woke me and indicated for me to be silent. He slipped
  into bed with me. Tom whispered, do not ask. Do not tell. My mouth was out of
  commission. He was not. He sucked every drop of cum out of me. He rolled me on
  my side and pumped me all night.\r

  A few of the other guys woke and saw what was happening. One just went back to
  sleep, and two jacked off watching me getting fucked. The nurse woke us up in
  bed together. He said, Hey guys, you have to clean up before the staff
  arrives. He was awesome. So we're all the ward of soldiers. It was as if a
  crew came in and got us cleaned up. The guy's all told me whether I was
  awesome gay or not. This might not sound like a big deal. Remember, these are
  all very alpha males. Very straight. Tom got Discharged from the hospital.\r

  About a week later, Tom shows up with flowers and candy. Tom visited me as
  often as he could until I was out of the hospital. \r

  \r

  A couple of weeks later At home,  My lover comes into the bedroom one morning,
  not happy at all. He says your military guy is in the living room. Oh shit. I
  said,  No kidding.\r

  Tom was so handsome. My lover saw his eyes. then mine.  He knew at that moment
  things were different. I saw his eyes tear up, and it broke my heart. My lover
  loved me. My lover said I am going to go to the store. You guys have fun, and
  we will have a nice dinner when I return. I walked my lover out, and as he got
  in the car. He said I love you enough to let you go. He said. That man is
  madly in love with you, and I know you love him too. This was all true.  I was
  thinking about these things while he drove off.\r

  \ I decided to try for Tom. I got him, and We had fantastic sex. My lover
  showed up while we were in my bed. He was cool about it. He came in with
  drinks for us. Tom went to shower, and I said I would join him soon.\r

  My lover sat next to me on the bed. I expected drama. He just said I see you
  guys are falling for each other. I want only you to be happy, and even though
  I love you, I know to let you go. I want you as part of my life, even if it is
  not how I want it to be. He said you shower and have a fun dinner in two
  hours. Oh my god. What the hell am I doing? My lover was perfect, but my heart
  was not.\r

  Tom and I talked in the shower. I told him everything. Tom started to cry a
  bit. He asked me are you staying with him? I paused, water running over me. I
  knew this was a life-changing decision, and I looked into Tom's eyes. I had
  fallen for Tom, and I had a great lover, but my heart was now Tom's. Tom was
  so happy. I had seen joy and sorrow before Tom was in heaven. I was pleased
  but had pain, too—my now ex-lover and dinner in one hour and six minutes.\r

  Dinner, believe it or not, was incredible. My ex had set a place for two. I
  felt awkward. EX said coolly. I ate already and want you guys to have a
  special dinner. He served a fantastic meal—all the bells and whistles. After
  dinner, we all had wine around the pool. My ex and Tom were talking. I felt
  odd and stressed, so I jumped into the pool.\r

  They talked for a long time. After I got out. My ex kisses me on the cheek. He
  said, tears in his eyes. Tom is awesome. I see why you fell for him. I said
  okay. He continued to tell me I love you enough to know Tom is good for you
  and he said I could remain friends with you guys as long as I could handle
  that. I whispered to my ex. You know, I feel bad. He stopped me and said do
  not let the heart do what it does. You did not seek Tom; he found you. I got a
  few of the best years of my life. Tom is coming out, he needs you, and he is a
  top. I know you prefer a top yet for all the time we have been together, not
  one time did you complain. It's his time. I kissed him. It was done.\r

  Tom and I then went swimming. When we got out, my ex had taken a few things
  and gone to stay with our friends. I got over my sad feelings. Tom could tell
  my heart was a bit tattered. He told me they had had a fascinating
  conversation. And Tom also said that guy loves you. You know. I started to
  cry. Tom held me all night. Tom was very scared. I might want what I let go
  of. I did not want him to live in doubt. I did something I rarely do. I lied.
  I told Tom the truth. He was a bottom, and I only stayed because he loved me
  so much. I was ready to find a new man already. The last part was a lie. Tom
  smiled and said you do not lie worth a shit. But thank you. Okay, that's it.
  We are all still friends even years later. Okay, the sex. Where is that in the
  story? Tom was built like a Greek god, The sex was fantastic.  I would swallow
  his Cock every morning, and he would bring me flowers or wine or something
  every night. He was romantic. \r

  On my birthdays a lot of things always happen to me. The party where nobody
  brought any presents. Every year, my house was known in my neighborhood and in
  the gay community to have a huge birthday bash. On my birthday, every year, I
  had invitations I would send out, and people would arrive with booze and
  presence. It was not unusual for my birthday parties to last four or five
  days. My birthday party was due to start, and people should be arriving in a
  couple of hours. So I had everything ready to go. And I was all excited about
  another birthday. My invitations have been sent out, everyone has replied, and
  it was going to be a large party for sure. I always had a table in the back
  room where people would put their coats and another in the living room where
  we served the cake. And I had a table where people would stack their presence.
  The party I was busy during and I never really paid much attention to the
  present table. I happened to notice there was no presence this year. Normally
  there would be quite a few. A lot of people did bring booze. I didn't care
  about the present too much. So I just went back to enjoying my evening, and
  everyone was getting drunk and having a good time swimming in the pool. We had
  cake, and everybody said Happy birthday. Now my parties tend to last a long
  time. I would go to sleep in my bedroom. And then, when I woke up, the party
  would still be going on. This was not unusual. This year was different. I was
  in my room not long, and it came from a guy who had a rubber on. He says I
  have your birthday present. That was fun. He left. Then another man comes in,
  and another and another all with rubbers on. What the heck was going on? The
  next guy comes in, and I say What's up? He said I am here to give you your
  present. I said dick yes? He said yes. Wrapped up just for you. He handed me
  my party invitation. It all looks normal. I read it. I got down to the last
  line, and I saw it says Be sure you come with your package wrapped, not
  present wrapped. Holy shit. the guy laughed and said you know you have about
  35 guys to go. I said, Oh no way, I am done now. He said Oh no, not till after
  me.  So I had the best present on my bed. A few guys went to the store and
  bought me a slide for my pool. They all gave me notes saying they owed me a
  special Wrapped package. I collected a few over the next year. I always
  double-check my invitations now. \r

  I dated my Boss and he gave me an awesome present. He wanted to show me a
  wonderful time for my birthday. He sent his stylists to prepare outfits for us
  to wear. A limo took us out and we had a wonderful meal, dancing. And he even
  took me to an art gallery. His friend was the featured artist. He turned his
  charms while giving me a private tour of his work. It was awesome. We got to
  the boss's home, and he arranged flowers around, yellow roses. My favorite
  flower!  Boss kissed me, and holy shit. I checked his cock out. He was
  beef.  You know those huge summer sausages they sell at hickory farms. Well
  yep huge, Boss made love to me so gently and took his time. He kissed and
  caressed me.  He had his way of making love. I swear this was the best sex I
  had ever had.  I slept in his arms and heard his heartbeat echo in his chest.
  \r

  The boss got up a bit before 6 am when I always woke up. He made a lovely
  breakfast and brought it to me in bed. I insist on the Boss getting in bed and
  eating it with me.  \r

  After eating He said I have a special birthday treat for you. In comes a hairy
  chest guy. \"You have never seen a Cuban man naked, is that correct? I said
  Yes, that's true. He gave me a sexy smile.  That hot Cuban man told me to come
  here and look closer. I did. He felt very sexual to me as I touched him. He
  looked at me and said, you may find something you will like if you look a bit
  lower, he dropped his pants. Holy crap. It was dark and long with lots of
  foreskins. I just had to grab it. He took control very fast. He fed me that
  dick. Afterward he let me run my fingers through the hair on his
  chest.  Mr.Cuban  Hottie walked to the boss and said, What would you like me
  to do?  the boss said it was my baby's birthday. I want to see you fuck my
  boy.  That Latin man and I gave the boss the show of his life. He pulled out
  of me and hugged me, dressed and kissed me on the cheek, and left. \r

  Birthday Bill. \r

  Bill was a factory manager at a meatpacking plant. He worked lots of hours and
  lived next to the plant. His whole family has been butchers, and they have
  worked for the company since it opened. I thought he was straight. I was at a
  sports bar enjoying a free birthday meal. Bill came over, and we started
  celebrating my birthday. After a few hours, I said I wanted to check in with
  my office. Bill said he would hang out with me. After you check in, how long
  are you free? he asked. I told him I was free till the day I flew out. We both
  went back to my room. And I made my call. I sat on the small couch in my room.
  I was happy to have a minibar at home. I don't drink, and I had plenty
  already. However, I was nervous around Bill because he was hot. We talked
  about pretty ordinary things, the news, the weather, but it was how he said
  things, voice and attitude, tone and expression, all indicating sexual arousal
  and desire. But still, nothing said would truly indicate a sexual advance on
  my part. Then Bill just in the middle of the conversation, Bill flat-out asks
  me if I want a blow job for my birthday. Without me saying anything. lustily.
  He leans in his hand and slides down my chest towards my semi-hard cock. It
  was not long before Bill was on all fours on the floor before me. I am sitting
  on my couch. This super sexy man is blowing me, I think to myself. I have to
  tell you that I enjoyed getting my cock sock off. I blew my load, and my body
  shook as it came. Not just once. Two, three. blasts. Bill said Happy birthday.
  I know you're gay, and I figured you would enjoy it. I said, heck yes. The
  bound birthday. \r

  It was my 26th birthday, and I was on a business trip to Washington, DC. I was
  traveling with my friend. I called Eddie the mooch. He never had enough money.
  But he was an excellent friend in every other way. And he and I were in some
  bar drinking. We were checking all the bars out. I was getting very drunk. And
  Eddie was picking up a sexy man. I wasn't paying attention to any of the men
  around me. I was enjoying my cocktail watching, and he performed for his main
  target. The bar was getting full, and I was ready to leave when he came to me
  and said he was taking off with his guy. Eddie was gone, and I sat at the bar.
  I was a little upset because Eddie had forgotten it was my birthday. I
  finished my drink. And the bartender said, you see that guy with the tattoos
  at the end of the bar? I looked over and saw who he was talking about and
  said, Yes, I do. The bartender said he wanted to buy you a drink. Okay, I
  asked if he would come and properly introduce himself. The bartender looked me
  in the eye and said, Listen, l don't know him well, but he has been here
  several times, and he seems okay. He is top and probably rough. I leaned in
  and asked if he thought he was safe. The bartender said people probably knew
  him and that he lived close by. He walked over to me, and I will never forget
  how sexy he looked. He wore skin-tight leather pants with a wide heavy belt
  clasp and a large silver buckle. You could make out the sinews of his muscular
  legs, even through his leather pants. He showed a large box stretching the
  leather of his fly. He had no shirt on, and a washboard stomach rippled as he
  walked. He had a firm, nice chest and a ring on his nipple. He had that sexy
  v-line on either side of his pelvis. His arms were muscular, and he had sexy
  tattoos all over his body. As he walked, he had a swagger of confidence and
  masculinity. Hi, my name is Tom, he said in an intense voice. We talked about
  everything under the sun. Tom was very charming and not exactly as I expected.
  He told me he had a warehouse close to that he was fixing up to rent out the
  loft and studio apartments. We found a sex quiz at the bar and enjoyed asking
  each other the questions. One question was, what is your most hot sexual
  fantasy? I told him that mine was to be tied up and taken by a bunch of guys.
  Tom told me he would be the bunch of guys in my fantasy. I laughed. I thought
  he was being clever and cute. We kept drinking and chatting. It came up in
  conversation that it was my birthday. Tom sang Happy birthday to me in the
  bar. I was reading from blushing, and he made me feel special. We danced and
  drank. We talked a lot. Tom said, Let me make a few calls, and then we can
  celebrate your birthday at my place. Tom took me out of the bar, a short walk
  to his place. We arrived at an old brick building. It was in not too bad
  condition. You could see current work was going on. Tom kissed me with
  excitement as he showed me a house project. I must admit I was impressed. Then
  he asked me to dance for him. The studio was completely done. It had been a
  while since I danced professionally, but I was still good. I danced as the
  stereo played. When dancing, the world disappears, and I am the music and
  movement. After I finished, I was sweating. Tom said to put these sweats on
  after you shower. I will toss these in the wash. Oh, I have arranged a
  birthday present in the early morning. We took a shower together, and he
  explored my whole body. I felt him all over too. His body was so muscular. It
  felt like chiseled stone. We got out of the shower and went to the living
  room. Tom showed me his tattoos and talked about them as he flexed his
  muscles. He walks close to me. His cock is near my face as he stands in front
  of my chair. Then his towel drops. He has a tiny dragon just to the right of
  his pubic hair. I can't help but notice his washboard stomach and the lines of
  muscles on his pelvis. He was looking down at me, and I looked up. What have
  you? Tom smiled big and said, Oh, you like the view. I smiled. I lay there
  naked. Looking up at him. I felt so vulnerable and small next to this massive
  study of a man. His smell of booze, soap, and musk in my nose. his crotch is
  inches from me. He lifted me and kissed me. It was like no other kiss. I
  melted in this beast of a man. I hear him say you do have eyes. Pretty lips.
  Tom took me to the bedroom and said get in bed and roll over. Let me see that
  as I did and turn my head to look back at him. Tom said that it is wonderful
  to have ten and smooth. Tom's hand pulls on his cock. I looked into his face,
  and he had the sexiest dirty grin. I tasted salt and flesh as I licked around.
  He moaned, and surged thicker. He stood next to my bed. I enjoyed looking up
  at that flawless torso. I feel a rough hand thrust into my butt crack. I
  winced as sweat-covered fingers entered my whole body.  I remember feeling him
  going deep in me and out of me so many times. \r

  I wake in the morning hearing, Happy birthday.  I feel my hands tied behind my
  back and see guys standing around me. Tom, Dick, and Harry were their names. I
  hear. Okay, guys. It's time to show this boy his birthday fantasy. I then felt
  him grab my head. He forces himself down my throat. I go down on him to the
  base, and he makes me stay there choking.we all had sex. The pain and pleasure
  of it were amazing.  Harry said yes, that's a good boy. Scream all you want.
  We are going to tear your pussy up. Let me tell you; these men were so sexy
  and hot. Tom. His hair was sun-bleached brown hair. With his square jaw. He
  was handsome. He was tall and had big muscles.  He had a sexy deep voice. Tom
  was in and out of jail. I must say that guy named  dick had a big dick.  It
  was as big as a beer can. He was hairy and very sexy. He looked like a
  trucker. He had brown eyes and dark hair, and he looked very mean and
  dangerous. He was just out of jail. He had massive arms, sexy tattoos, and a
  super-fit body.   I obeyed and they definitely fulfilled my Group Fantasy. \r

  Sexy bikers scare me and turn me on. I arrived at a Harley dealership. There
  were several other guys walking around. I was scared, but it was also getting
  hard. A couple of the guys, mechanics, were sexy with White, dirty, sweaty
  t-shirts. All the guys are fit and rough. \r

  As soon as I was in the center of the group. They all started to undress me. I
  could feel all those big men with strong hands removing my clothes and
  touching me.  the shop floor room. It had Harley bikes, and there was a pit
  group couch set for customers in the middle of the room.  I knelt on my knees
  and started at one end of the pit group. I noticed all of them were pretty
  much aroused by the time I got to each one of them. It was fantastic. And yes,
  I did feel like a dirty little slut. \r

  Next,  They grabbed me and carried me to a workbench in the back room. Face
  down, and they tied my hands and feet. One slowly started fucking me. Then
  deeper, side to side. The other guys wanted to show off how much better they
  could use me.  They all took turns showing off.\r

  ________________\r

  \ One biker, Tom, took me alone to his house. As soon as we arrived, he said,
  get naked on your hands and knees. He took his clothes off and sat in his
  chair. It was a sexy view seeing those manly legs spread far apart. His
  awesome body is leaning back, and his large member is sticking up. I am on all
  fours in front of him. He maneuvered my head right onto his cock tip.  I could
  hear him moaning as I twisted my head and bobbed up and down on him.  I
  couldn't get enough. I worked on him for about 10 to 15 minutes. \r

  Next He knelt behind me, and Tom slapped my butt. Spread them, pretty boy.  I
  am not trying to hurt you. If I wanted to hurt you. I would have just did you
  from the get-go. As he spoke dirty to me Tom was breathing heavily and flexing
  his body. Yeah, you can take it exclaimed Tom. I groaned as he said, Oh my
  god. That's it, boy. All inside.  He grabs my hair as I feel him, banging
  me.  Then he turns me and throws me on my back, legs in his hands. Again I
  feel him in me hours. \r

  (a really old picture of my long term lover, well over 20 years, monogamous
  still with me but we both flirt and maybe 1 or 2 times a year, with permission
  I have actually gone on a date with some hot guys. Yes we are in our 50s but
  as a top I have several 25-35 year olds after me. My lover is a bottom and
  claims he has not fooled around all the way, FYI he is more, traditionals on
  his views of relationships. I did monogamy to please him. 2nd photo is a year
  ago)\r

  I need to start by saying in my relationships that I have mostly been
  long-term and monogamous, but those are my relationships.\r

  Situations with others have been interesting.\r

  \r

  My very first unusual gay relationship was with a bartender. Bruce was a very
  handsome bartender and very sexy. I was young and built like a swimmer, not
  big but fit. Bruce was a few years older. He had a lover for a couple of
  years, and they broke up when I met him. He had picked me up, and I was at his
  apartment. His lover had already moved out. It was late at night, and we were
  on the couch. Bruce and I were cuddling, and his lover Ted walked in to get
  some of his stuff. Bruce was quite upset; it was very awkward. After Ted left,
  Bruce was crying, and I comforted him. The sex was fantastic, by the way. \r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  A couple of days later, I was sleeping over at Bruce's house while he was at
  work. It was about 11 pm, and I woke to see Ted standing over me right next to
  the bed. Ted was a burly guy with dark eyes and a military haircut. He was a
  leather guy.  Ted told me to be quiet. I could tell I was in trouble. Long
  story short, he left Bruce because he wasn't into S and M, Ted liked to
  dominate. Before I knew what happened or even how, I had a belt around my
  neck, bound wrists, and 9 inches of Ted in my mouth. I remember trying to get
  away. He used me till almost 1 am, then left me  gagged naked, beaten. \r

  Bruce got home and freed me at 3 am after work.\r

  Bruce is holding me in the morning as the sun peeks through closed drapes. I
  see him sleeping, and his face is gorgeous—Manly, As I was enjoying the view,
  Ted and two other big guys burst into the bedroom. Bruce fought them hard, but
  they subdued Us both. On my knees bent over one side of the bed, and Bruce on
  the opposite side in the Bent over position. They placed us, so we were
  looking into each other's faces. All day those guys used Bruce and me as we
  looked at each other.\r

  After they let us go and left, I remember sitting on the shower floor as the
  water ran over me. I was in a cross between shock, victimization, and abuse,
  yet, deep inside, it was so freaking hot.  \r

  ________________\r

  Interestingly enough, in college, my first boyfriend I selected, and I also
  had a pair of lesbian lovers. We would often go on double dates growing up in
  the Midwest in the '80s, which made it more convenient. Periodically, while
  Steve and I were having sex, the two girls would be next to us engaging in sex
  also.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Steve and I only did a 3-way a few times in California with another pair of
  lovers. Mark and Rick.\r

  I lived as a roommate with Mark and Rick while Steve was in the Navy. Mark was
  a chef in a posh restaurant and was a big handsome Italian guy. Rick was about
  my size and Louisiana Creole. The situation while my lover was in the Navy and
  I was living with them was the best three-way situation I ever had and
  enjoyable in my life. I had my bedroom, but 50% of the time, I slept in bed
  with those two men. That big Italian Daddy was hung like a horse, and that hot
  Creole stud was a hot bottom. They treated me like a lover too. It was
  awesome.\r

  Steve came home, and it was odd for a while. They never told Steve that we had
  had three ways or anything else. It felt weird to me because I missed them.
  Well, one day, about two months later, I went out with somebody after work,
  and I got drunk. I picked up a guy on the beach, and he fucked me in his van.
  I was drinking as I walked in. The guys were sitting on the sofa watching TV.
  I said, \"Steve, come here, ok? I just got fucked in a van, but, well, it was
  small, and I need cock. This is what you're going to do.\" Mark and Rick got
  up to leave. I said, \" Oh no, sit back down, guys, yes, on the couch.\"
  Staggering as I was stripping my clothing off, I told them that I was going to
  bend over the ottoman, and 1st My Lover, Then Rick, Then Mark was going to do
  me. I showed them my hole. Sexually, I began begging them to show me who could
  do me the best. That was a hot time. I got real drama for a while from Steve,
  mostly.\r

  \r

  \r

  Drama is something that, although I try to avoid the fact, you will always
  have some to one degree or another.\r

  \r

  \r

  Before I had experience in dating and relationships I even was Blackmailed.
  That is another reason I wrote this book. \r

  \r

  \r

  I lived in an inexpensive apartment complex. The apartments were small, but I
  was in college, and it was good enough.\r

  \r

  \r

  I worked for my next-door neighbor. Lisa was my boss at the bar I barbacked
  at. She loved me and gave me the most effortless best-paid shifts. Sounds
  incredible, right? I had one big problem. The required liquor license I didn't
  have. I used a friend's number on the job application form. Lisa did not know,
  or she would have to fire me even after I got a suitable license. I needed the
  job badly.\r

  \r

  \r

  I got my liquor license, but there was no way to get the old information back
  to replace it. Lisa and I always worked together, and life was great. I had
  money and time to study too. Lisa lived with a hot guy named mike. He was a
  jerk but gorgeous! They had gotten married in high school, and both of them
  were happy. Lisa was beautiful, and they were a great couple for the most
  part. Mike, as I mentioned, was a jerk. He was 6 feet tall with a slender
  build. Even though he was lean, his body was all muscles and perfect. He had
  black straight hair that accented his light skin. His eyes could melt an
  iceberg. Sexy and sultry all the time, even without him trying. He was a jock
  and worked for Bowflex as a salesman. We all got along ok, but I preferred it
  when Mike was not around.\r

  \r

  \r

  Mike was always home on Tuesday, and I had Tuesday off most weeks. Lisa always
  had to work, and then after bar hours on Tuesday, she did the books.\r

  \r

  \r

  Mike came over to my apartment on Tuesday. He was sitting at my desk looking
  at a computer game I had just bought. I hear, “What is this?” as he holds up
  my liquor license, which was on my desk. I had to come clean and tell him
  about my number on file. Mike didn't say much. He acted like since I had a
  good one, it was no big deal.\r

  \r

  \r

  Two Tuesday's later. Mike comes over, but it feels different. He asks me about
  being gay. For example, if I am a boy or a girl. He wondered how big a cock I
  could suck. I was very uncomfortable; however, I answered his questions. Then
  Mike said, “I own you! If I tell Lisa, she will fire you because you put wrong
  information on your application.” I said, “yes, I know.” Mike then said, “I
  thought about it and decided I would keep your secret, but you will have to
  pay me.” I thought to myself, what a jerk, but ok, I have no choice. Mike
  said, “I have in mind exactly an amount! Can you guess how much?” I just
  shrugged my shoulders and said no.\r

  \r

  \r

  Mike stood up and walked close to me, and explained. Lisa only can get half of
  my cock in her mouth, and since you are gay, I figured you would get off on
  getting me off every Tuesday. he unzipped his pants and pulled out a 13-inch
  cock.\r

  \r

  \r

  You probably are thinking that I was lucky and that I would enjoy this
  happening to me. No, I loved Lisa and was now in a position that if I told her
  about Mike or My License, it would be awful. Mike was sexy as hell but a jerk!
  He treated me like a whore as he would roughly force me to suck and swallow
  his cum multiple times every Tuesday.\r

  \r

  \r

  This went on for about four months until one Tuesday. Mike came over with a
  bottle of Booze and a gym bag. I had only given Mike blowjobs until Mike said,
  “This time, you will say nothing and do what I tell you.” Mike ripped my
  clothing off. He grabbed me hard and forcefully made me bend over the back of
  the sofa. I heard the zipper on the gym bag open up, and I looked over. He
  pulled out a great big dildo. “Lisa does not like ass sex, and I don't mind it
  because I get great pussy. The other day I saw porn and decided to use you to
  play.``He stuck his finger in my hole, then with his other hand he put a
  second finger and pulled my ass open. Mike did an excellent job, to tell the
  truth, licking me out, and Getting me wet inside. He talked filthily and
  degradingly to me as he switched from eating me out and fingering. Next, he
  was using the dildo on me, and he used it pretty safely at first, but then he
  got very rough with it.\r

  \r

  \r

  I think he enjoyed himself because he acted like it, and at the very end, he
  pulled a dildo out of me, and I felt his huge cock ramming into my ass. He
  fucked me savage and hard. His pounds of deep thrusts banged hard as his balls
  slapped against me. I feel him come shooting and filling my insides. Mike
  pushed as deep as he could and his cock surged, injecting the last drop of cum
  in me. I moaned as his cock pulled out of me, and the juice dripped out of my
  hole onto the Ground.\r

  \r

  \r

  He only ever fucked me that one time, and he came back a few more times for
  blow jobs.\r

  Common Signs of a romance scammer.\r

  \r

  \r

  Online dating sites can be a wonderful tool to help find a partner. However,
  by being aware of the signs of a dating scam, such as bad grammar or requests
  for personal and financial information, you will know if you are a victim of a
  dating scam. Romance scammers are experts in social manipulation and can sound
  very convincing. Many signs of a romance scammer are subtle and insidious
  because the scammer is trying to build trust before they exploit you. To avoid
  online dating scams. Be on the lookout for these red flags when getting to
  know someone online. Romance scammers profess love quickly without actually
  meeting you. Frequently, the first sign of an online dating scam shows up when
  a romance scammer expresses strong emotions in a relatively short time. They
  may even say that they're in love with you, but it's a tactic they're using to
  get you to give up personal details and answers to the security questions you
  use to lock down your accounts across the internet. guard your personal
  information carefully and be wary of a new love interest who asks for personal
  details soon after contact. He loves sight unseen. Love you is a statement
  that everyone wishes to hear. But how do you know if it's real? scammers tell
  you they love you before they have ever met you in real life. Think about it.
  How do you know if there's real charisma there? Some people can sound great on
  the phone. But when you meet them, there's nothing there. Or physically, they
  don't meet your standards. How can someone honestly love you before having met
  you in person? Romance scammers claim to need money for emergencies, hospital
  bills, or travel. be suspicious of anyone who asks you for financial
  assistance, no matter how dire their circumstances seem. If you encounter one
  of these storylines when you're talking to a new love interest on the
  internet, there's a good chance they're scamming you. I need money to support
  a sick relative. I need a short-term loan for airfare to visit you. I need
  some startup money for a business venture. I need funds to finalize a loved
  one's funeral. I'm a US service member overseas, and I need some money. Online
  romance scammers try to lure you off the dating site. Frequently, scammers
  convince victims to leave the dating site and use personal email or instant
  messaging to continue communication. At first, this might not seem like a red
  flag. When you get to know someone, you will naturally want to move beyond the
  dating site and use other forms of communication. Be very cautious when
  someone asks for your phone number or email address. This makes it even easier
  for them to access your personal information. If you want to communicate
  outside the dating site, set up an alternate email address or utilize an
  instant messaging app that isn't connected to personal information like your
  primary email and phone number. Romance scammers plan to visit, but they
  always cancel because of some emergency. If an online love interest makes
  plans to visit but always seems to change their plans at the last second
  because of a traumatic event, family drama, or a business loss, you should be
  very suspicious. Often, their cancellation will accompany a request for a
  short-term loan. Look out for someone who says something like I want to meet
  you. But I can't buy a plane ticket right now. Because of x. If you buy me a
  ticket, I will pay you back. I want to be together. Please pay attention to
  their grammar. One of the first clues of an online dating scam is bad grammar.
  While not everyone who has bad grammar is a scammer. If the person you are
  talking to online also suggests that they have a high education level. This
  should be a warning sign. If their grammar or sentence structure seems odd,
  things don't seem to add up. It is likely to be a scam. Do a quick Google
  search. If you are talking to someone, Search their name, email address, and
  username. The name, email, or username may appear in search of frequent online
  scammers. Online scammers often use other people's online images. Sometimes
  online scammers adopt a real person's identity to make their scam more
  believable. He flaunts his income. Most people who earn a decent living wish
  to be wanted for who they are, not for their income. Yet, scammers often
  indicate that they make more than 150,000 a year to set up people who want to
  know them for their income and not for themselves. This way, when he says he's
  gotten into a jam and requests money, the unsuspecting person thinks her
  investment or loan will get reimbursed. Be realistic. Unfortunately, if it
  seems too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true. Be aware of
  people who are significantly younger than you or profess their love for you
  too quickly. Someone significantly younger than you might only be interested
  in a relationship for financial security. Remember that true love takes time,
  and claims of love, at first sight could be a warning sign that you are being
  scammed. For example, if you are a 65-year-old retiree and a 25-year-old model
  shows interest in having a relationship. It should raise suspicion. He avoids
  questions. How tall are you? What do you do for a living? It's almost as if
  his mail is sent automatically like you're on his list, and this is the next
  standard email sent out. His answering with questions to your specific
  questions is a sign of a scammer as he isn't giving you an actual answer.\r

  \r

  If it begins, it eventually will end, but it could be in a week or in 75
  years.\r

  We live in a culture that is obsessively hyper-sexualized and romanticized. My
  only piece of advice is this. Please don't fall for it—deeper into people
  beyond the surface. There are so many great relationships to be made with your
  friends, co-workers, family, or anyone around you. Don't limit yourself by
  placing romantic standards on the people around you as long as you're actively
  engaging with the people in your life who look upon you with love, spiritual
  or not. You're never as alone as you feel happy ever after. It's never come
  without fight and struggle. So think of your breakup as just another bump
  before reaching the final page of your life story.\r

  When You reach 50-55 being grumpy, having 'issues' or mood swings? Well, you
  could be going through menopause or male menopause.\r

  I’ve found exceptional value over the years in the benefits of meditation -
  and enjoy the peace that follows, presumably, if done correctly. \r

  In the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has effectively doubled
  - and with new technology and awareness of how to live healthily\r

  As men age, their testosterone levels drop, leading to a condition called
  andropause.\r

  Testosterone is a hormone produced in the testes that fuel the sex drive,
  changes during puberty, and mental and physical energy. It maintains muscle
  mass, regulates a man's fight-or-flight response, and regulates key
  evolutionary features.\r

  With women, the ovaries run out of ova just before or during menopause.
  However, the man never runs out of sperm, and a healthy male can produce sperm
  well into his 80s. But, symptoms like low sex drive, night sweats, hot
  flashes, and weight gain are common amongst men and women.\r

  It comes as a gradual and distressful decline in sexuality and overall energy
  with increasing moodiness. As testosterone helps regulate your mood when this
  level drops, men feel depressed, feel sad and have problems like emptiness,
  anxiety, irritability, or anger.\r

  Exercise - it releases endorphins to put you in a good mood afterward AND
  raises testosterone. Yes, being older sucks since you are decomposing in front
  of your own eyes, and maybe young guys do not look at you the way they used to
  (according to some research I read, men lose all their physical attraction at
  the age of 53 - and you should find someone your age, really) but you can rely
  on charm. There are a bunch of ladies or dudes out there that would love to
  spend time with you. Some are even naked. The sex needs to be good, and It
  keeps the relationship going. If you want your relationship to last more than
  a year, there need to be genuine reasons why you’re dating him that have
  nothing to do with sex. Sex becomes less critical as the relationship goes
  on.\r

  My health. That’s tricky, considering I should have died several times.   It's
  Christmas Eve 2022 and this Christmas is different from any I've ever had in
  my past.. It's 4:00 a.m. And I am sitting alone reflecting on my life. My long
  term partner spends all his time away from me. Even if he is here he is not
  really. To put it bluntly, What happened?  I know it is really sad. I had a
  stroke a few years ago. He was so happy I did not die and agreed to help me
  get around and care for me. Well that lasted 6 months. As I decline in health
  He does less and less. There have been weeks that I only see him once a
  day.  At times I can't even walk. The reason I mention this is to warn people
  that no matter how much you love someone when health changes your ability to
  care for yourself, never expect someone to be there for you. One way or
  another you will end up alone. To fix this you must realize you are not the
  person you were. You are a burden now. Others will only carry a burden a short
  time before they fade away no matter their original intentions. As a result of
  unreliable care I had to make hard decisions. Getting rid of my farm and
  moving into town is a must. In January I go to the hospital and arrange for
  home care. That's all ok but seeing everything I worked my whole life for,
  boxed for sale and the person I spent 25plus year's talking to others on the
  phone and fading away is heartbreaking. Honestly I say nothing because I am on
  my way to being weak and needing constant care. I know I am out of time. How
  can I ask my partner to waste the next 2 to 5 years caring for me? After I go
  he will get nothing but a dead lover. At our age he would be too old to find a
  new partner. My heart breaks knowing the best thing to do is let him go.
  Honestly I would not have tried to survive my stroke if I realized the cost to
  those that care for me. Anticipatory grief is deep sadness felt during the
  last days of life. It can be experienced by both the dying person and the
  dying person's loved ones. Some people find this very painful. They may feel
  they are betraying their loved one if they lean at all towards letting go.\r

  The truth is, it is possible to live with both holding on and letting go at
  the same time. \r

  It is also grief for the other losses that go along with death, such as:\r

  The loss of a companion\r

  The loss of shared memories\r

  The loss of dreams for the future\r

  Sometimes, grief from the past may resurface during this time.\r

  Denying the pain you feel now can prolong grief later on. Grief serves a
  purpose, whether it occurs before death or after death.\r

  People sometimes talk about how hard it is to spend time with a dying loved
  one. They may not want to remember their loved one as they were dying.
  Instead, they may want to remember how the person was before their illness. \r

  I just felt I needed to share my thoughts. I am glad to remember a fantastic
  life. I just need to figure out exactly how my story will end. \r

  \r

  Next I am sharing my  Father and Son affair\r

  \  \r

  \r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  Jim and Paul. Paul was like any next-door neighbor. The son was about ready to
  go on active duty in the army. The father, Paul, was in the military himself
  and some high-ranking officers. I can't remember exactly his rank but, He was
  in command of a lot of soldiers. We were in San Antonio, Texas. I had a nice
  pool and yard in which his fence was at the back corner of my property. I let
  them use my swimming pool sometimes, and they were great neighbors. Paul had
  been divorced for about three years, so it was just the two men there. Paul
  had been swimming and was on my deck when I pulled up after a week of
  traveling for business. He was very handsome with his fit body and broad
  shoulders. I went into my house and took a shower.\r

  \r

  \r

  After showering, I went to my pool to do a few laps before crashing into the
  bed. I was surprised to see Paul swimming when I came out. But no biggie. I
  dived in and started my laps. Paul was floating in the chair in the middle of
  the pool. I noticed as I did my laps, he was always watching me. I then hear
  Paul splash into the water. He is swimming alongside me. We race swimming
  sometimes, so even though I was tired, I did my best to outswim him. He was a
  good swimmer but a big guy. I had some swimming training. So, I won often.
  Soldiers don't like losing, you know, especially a masculine one. Before I
  could make the last bit of swimming distance. Paul grabs my ankle and stops
  me. I feel myself moving backward in the water. He pulls me near him, and we
  splash each other. He flips me in the air, and I splash as I hit the water. We
  stop roughhousing, and I am wiping my eyes. After I could see, I noticed Paul
  was holding me standing right in front of me. I prepared for another toss in
  the air. But much to my surprise, Paul pulls me close to him. one hand reaches
  into my trunks, and he grabs my ass. I was in shock and froze still. He tells
  me he has not been with a guy ever but, for a year, he has thought about
  fucking my ass. He explained that he didn't date women because of the job and
  his son was ready now not to need him. I just stayed still. Paul explained to
  me he didn't want anyone to know he wanted to fuck me. He said he just had to
  see what being with me was like. I, believe it Or not, suggested he find a
  girl or some gay guy far from home. He said it had to be me.\r

  \r

  \r

  \  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  I felt flattered. Usually, that works pretty well for me. I need to explain.
  Paul was a man! An absolute stud, macho, badass, kick-ass, tough mother
  fucker.\r

  His voice was deep and powerful. Paul carried himself in a commanding way, and
  It's hard to describe. His hair was brown-reddish in a military cut. He had
  sexy Gray Green eyes. He had a hairy chest and washboard stomach—a sexy tattoo
  on his arms which were huge with muscles.\r

  \r

  \r

  He picked me up in his arms and carried me out of the pool like it was
  nothing. Yes, up the ladder and no handrail. That takes some real strength and
  balance. He drys me off with a towel. Paul is hard. You may think I mean his
  Cock. I mean all over his body, muscles like stone. His Cock was like a
  flagpole that had to be 11 inches long.\r

  \r

  \r

  We walked into my home. I was going to head to the bedroom but, as soon as the
  back door closed, Paul threw me down on the floor. No foreplay. Nothing. He
  was ravenous with lust.\r

  \r

  \r

  I feel his rough hand thrust in my butt crack. I winced as Paul's big fingers
  roughly entered my hole. “Fuck boy, your little pussy is great.” He said as he
  pulled my hair and bit my ear. He laid on top of me. I was on my stomach with
  my arm being held in place. He just rammed all of me hard. I cried out in
  pain. He began fucking me. Luckily I was able to get over the pain I was in.
  Now, I am feeling good. He was so in need of sex. He was like an animal for a
  long time, and he was very good at fucking. I felt his cum explode inside
  me.\r

  \r

  \r

  After he came, he was in a daze. He then seems to realize how aggressively He
  did me. He had the sweetest facial expression as he began to apologize. He
  just had to have it. He went on to say that he hadn’t been with anyone in a
  very long time. I was very cool about it. I said, Let's take a shower, and I
  will show you what sex is all about. So we did, and he was awesome.\r

  \r

  \r

  Paul was worn out, and so was I. So we had fallen asleep in my bed. I woke up
  to see Jim, Paul's son, with his fingers over his lips, and he put a hand over
  my mouth. I indicated I would be quiet. I slipped out of the bedroom and
  followed Jim to my bar near the patio. We were far enough away, we could talk,
  and Paul would not hear. Jim was not happy at all. He thought I must have
  tricked his dad or got him drunk. I calmly said, No, that was not what
  happened. Jim knew me, and he didn't argue at all. He knew I was a sincere
  person. He sat on the floor, put his hand on his head as he hunched over. I
  sat on the floor next to him. I said, What is so wrong? Are you afraid your
  dad's gay? He looks into me and says, Well, no, not really. But I am gay. I
  said, What the fuck all this time? It bothers me that you didn't tell me. Jim
  says no, I never do anything. I was going to come here tonight and tell you I
  wanted you. I couldn't help myself. Jim choose now to come out to me and Paul
  to fuck me after a long time and no hint of anything. I started to laugh so
  inappropriately. But Jim looked at me and then must have seen my view of the
  evening. He started laughing, and we got up off the floor. Then he kisses me.
  I back away and say, Hey, you, what are you doing? Your dad just fucked the
  hell out of me and is in my bed as we speak. What are you doing? He puffed up
  and said, he is too old for you. I will show you I am more manly than him.
  Holy crap. I thought about what an aging drag queen told me years ago, “bitch,
  you get in the middle of a family sex thing. Girlfriend, you run for the
  hills, no matter how good that Cock is.”\r

  \r

  \r

  I didn't listen. Jim was more significant even than his dad and Prime Beef. I
  said, Well, at least wait till your dad isn't in my bed. I told the wrong
  thing. He grabs me and takes me to the bedroom, and Paul wakes, and Jim sets
  me in a chair. I am scared to death, and they didn't react as badly as I
  expected. Jim told his dad he wanted me. Paul freaked out about that, but not
  too bad. Paul felt uncomfortable, and Jim was aggravating him. Finally, I
  said, okay boys, enough of this shit. You both want to fuck me for different
  reasons. You men will need to work that shit out on your own. Paul, you will
  tell Jim you love him. Jim, grow up. You do not need to prove anything to me.
  Both you men are going to fuck me here, and Now and together.\r

  I continued, ``Jim and I got undressed, and Paul, you get in my bed.” They
  just looked at me with a stunned expression. I said in a loud voice. “Now!
  Snap to it!” I said, “there will be no insist crap. You will both fuck me and
  then get out. I need to get some sleep.” I was cranky, and the old queen's
  voice was in my head, “Honey child, No matter how butch, rough, and tough a
  man is, when it comes to sex, the woman or queen has to be the boss. they’ll
  be putty in your hand's sister.” Damn, that queen was right again.\r

  \r

  \r

  I told Paul, you go to stand at the foot of the bed. Jim lay in bed. Daddy
  fucks First. I told them. I sucked Jim, a bigger Cock than his dad's. Paul
  fucked me.\r

  \r

  \r

  Okay, now they were enjoying themselves. The stress was gone, and I told them
  to switch places. Soon Paul came into my mouth. Jim was really surprisingly
  fantastic in bed. I didn't let on, but that young stud was better than his
  dad. Both were excellent. Jim just kept fucking me. He came over and over but
  never stopped. I looked up at Paul's face as I sucked him, and we exchanged a
  look. His face seems to beam with pride over how good his son fucked me. My
  face looked like I needed to sleep. I was glad I was awake, however. I didn't
  have the heart to stop Jim. He was fucking me. True, but I could tell it's
  more than fucking. He touched me as if you were a lover. Not a toy. I let him
  go until he was done. Jim fell into the bed on my left, dad on my right hand.
  I passed out asleep.\r

  \r

  \r

  In the morning, both men were having coffee on my patio. They had worked it
  out. Jim wanted to be with me. Paul enjoyed the night but didn't have love
  feelings for me like Jim. I said, Great, guys, let's have breakfast. So I
  cooked.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  Gg\r

  Paul and the new boy.\r

  \r

  \r

  I enjoyed a long relationship with Paul. And I found out that I most likely
  was going to need to move for business. I knew Paul needed a boy, but he would
  not probably choose Well. He only knew my gay friends, and most of them were
  nice but not good enough. I am at the store one day, and this cute boy is in
  line at the checkout. He looks exactly as Paul had described the perfect man.
  His lover had just broken up with him on the phone. He was upset. I suggested
  he come to my place and meet some people I had coming over. Only Paul was
  coming. He agreed.\r

  \r

  \r

  He, Billy, wanted me and I wanted to test him out.\r

  We went swimming then got out to have a drink. Billy was standing in front of
  me with a towel around his waist. His body was lightly tanned skin over
  ripples of defined muscles. I liked that he had a sexy little line of hair,
  running up his washboard stomach. He noticed me checking him out. saying
  nothing drops his towel.\r

  \r

  \r

  His Cock was nice and just the right size to me Billy jumped down on his knees
  and put a hand on each of my legs. I feel his hands move up under my swim
  trunks. He looked hot in between my legs. He started to play with my balls and
  Cock. I just let him. I looked down, and I could see his face nuzzling my
  crotch. I could tell Billy was hungry for my Cock. He pulls my shorts off.
  Billy, on his knees, started licking my shaft up and around, then put it in
  his mouth.\r

  After he sucked me a while I picked him off the floor and told him to stand in
  front of me. He had a pretty thick white, pink head, big Cock. Foreskin too. I
  sucked him and it got even bigger. I deep swallowed him a few times and bam he
  shot such a load. I felt his hot cum shooting into my mouth. it came flooding
  out. I liked looking at his Pink small nipples in his short chest hair.
  Billy’s uncut dick hung down over smooth balls. It was getting hard. Billy
  said. I want to suck, may I? I nodded as I pointed to my Cock.\r

  \r

  \r

  Billy jumped down on his knees and put a hand on each of my legs. He looked
  horny and hot in between my legs. He pulls my shorts off. Billy licked my
  balls then as he looked up at me, licked the head of my Cock. He goes down on
  me. He is doing really well. I can feel him getting more and more of me in
  him. Then I see his ass in the mirror that is across the room from us. I got
  really turned on when I saw Billy's finger reach back. He touched his firm
  round butt's tiny pink hole. Billy’s butt arched up as he saw me lick my
  fingers. I lightly spank his ass. It was hot seeing a slight red handprint on
  his cheek. Then I force my head with one hand down on my Cock. I rub my finger
  all around his hole. Teasing him as he gagged on my rod.\r

  He was lost sucking on me. His mouth stretched, twisting as he swallowed my
  Cock up and down. I pulled him off my dick. That was Not an easy thing to do.
  He climbed up on the sofa and lay on top of me, curling up on my chest. His
  hands explored me all over. I was hot now, it was all I could do to not throw
  him on the floor and fucking savagely.\r

  “When you spoke to me with your deep voice, I thought you could do anything
  you wanted to me,” Billy told me. I took him to my bedroom. I am standing next
  to the bed, he crawls on the bed, flashing me his cute ass. I had him get on
  all fours and I got behind him. I will give him something to remember me by. I
  went to his sweet hole and started to lick him out. He jumped, I could tell
  this was Billy’s first rim job. that got me even hotter, I went deeper. Billy
  moaned with pleasure. I normally would have just plowed him. Instead, I went
  gently and put myself in that hot ass.\r

  \r

  \r

  He was ready for more. I did him every way possible. We moved all over the
  bedroom. Billy was really enjoying the sex too. We came a few times.\r

  \r

  \r

  Then we went swimming and soon Paul showed up in full army gear. He was
  running late. I saw the immediate attention each guy gave the other. The boy
  looked at me and was smart. He knew exactly what I was up to. They hit it off
  great, but Paul kept fidgeting. I knew he was Feeling odd because of me. I
  took over and told them I was going to clean up and they should go swimming. I
  will be out shortly before they go out. I told Paul, “if you care for me as I
  do you, see if he will be able to replace me.” Paul started to cry. I said,
  “none of that. This is just how life is.” I never went swimming. They went to
  the pool. I went to bed and cried. I didn't want it over, but it was time.\r

  \r

  \r

  The following day Paul came to my door, and I could see they had hit it off.
  He came to my house one last time. I acted like it was nothing. I said how I
  would miss him. I left soon after, never to hear from them or return. That
  drag queen had it all correct.\r

  Farm Help\r

  \r

  \r

  Kevin came to my farm to split wood. I did not know him. James was paid to do
  the job but got arrested and would not get out of prison for about three
  months. James knew Kevin from jail. Kevin owed James money. James sent him to
  split my wood and cut Kevin's debt to James. I didn't care as long as my wood
  got cut.\r

  \r

  \r

  Kevin calls, “I will come over tomorrow early and cut wood.” he hung up.\r

  \r

  \r

  I wake to hear Kevin splitting wood. I decided to get him a coffee and a
  frozen water bottle to drink. Plus, I wanted to see what he looked like.\r

  \r

  \r

  I will never forget the view of him shirtless swinging that ax. There is a
  light fog in the air, and the rays of the morning sun are shining diagonally
  through the trees across his body. He was super fit. You could see every
  muscle rippling with sweat as his arms swang over his head and crashed into
  the log, splitting them in half. His tanned body had sexy tattoos, rippling
  muscles and was mostly smooth.\r

  \r

  \r

  I handed him the coffee and the water bottle, and he was very grateful, but he
  was looking at me very odd, very strong, and analyzing. He was a very violent,
  dangerous man, and I could tell, so I kept my mouth shut. I offered to stack
  the wood and bring over the slices to split and cut his job in half. I would
  do it at least for a while until I had to go.\r

  \r

  \r

  Kevin and I worked together at a good pace. I couldn’t help staring at him. It
  was the beautiful thing saying that huge macho Stud of a man smashing that
  wood into pieces, his sweat pouring off of him.\r

  \  \r

  \r

  My cell phone rang, and my morning appointment was canceled. We did the
  woodpile job. Kevin was happy because of half the work in half the time. I was
  pleased because I got to watch a sexy man all morning.\r

  \r

  \r

  Kevin comes into the house to cool off. He asked if he could shower, and I
  offered to wash his jeans. I gave him a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt to
  wear. The shower I heard, and I sat in my chair. I closed my eyes and imagined
  Kevin naked in the shower. I dozed off.\r

  \r

  \r

  “Hey!” Kevin said as I woke up. He is standing in sweatpants but no shirt. He
  said. “Your t-shirt was too small.” I offered to look for a larger one. Don't
  worry, I am fine. He said. I must still have been sleepy because I said. Damn,
  right, you're fine. I realized as soon as I said that, oh shit, I hope he
  missed that, he got it. “James told me you were gay, but I could only tell a
  little by how you look at me.” he made a face and said, “I liked seeing you
  check me out.” as he said that, he grabbed his cock. I could see its head's
  shape and colossal size even with his sweats on. He was tensing his washboard
  stomach muscles and pumping his chest large and biceps as his other hand held
  that massive meat.\r

  \r

  \r

  Kevin said, “Do not tell James, or I will kick your ass. Do you get me? I
  never did a guy.”\r

  \r

  \r

  I couldn't believe how big\r

  his dick was. He was very proud of it, too, because when\r

  he got in front of me, he pushed me down to my knees\r

  and held it up in front of my face so that I could admire it.\r

  He slapped my face then hit his cock on my face.\r

  Kevin said,\r

  “You like that, don't you, being slapped around a little bit.\r

  Hmm, what will I do with you? I know! I will let you suck my dick!”\r

  \r

  \r

  It was about 12 inches long, as big around as a Beer can, and had a big head
  peeking out of\r

  his foreskin. As I looked up at him, he gave me a nasty sneer and\r

  ordered me to \"Open your mouth, boy. do as I say?\r

  Ok, there it is hard for you, yes there you go. The boy put that in your
  mouth.”\r

  \r

  \r

  His cock was so fat that I popped my jaw opening my mouth wide enough to get
  it in. he roughly jammed its head\r

  against the back of my throat. My mouth had never been\r

  so full.\r

  He grabbed my hair and held\r

  my head in place while he bangs his huge cock in and\r

  out of my mouth. As he fucked me, he snarled, \"Suck my\r

  dick, Oh yeah, take it, yeah suck that big cock, yeah, go all the way down.
  Yes, that's it, choke on it. You like that big cock in you, don't you, boy?” I
  had my mouth full but said, “yes, sir.”\r

  He said,\r

  Oh yes, boy, suck that cock, take that dick, yeah that it baby, keep
  swallowing my cock down. feel how hard it is for you?”\r

  \r

  \r

  His huge cock was pounding faster and deeply while I moaned, feeling him grind
  inside me deep. I said, “Oh yes, I want you to cum on my face and in my
  mouth.\r

  Kevin said,\r

  “Oh, come on, boy, all the way down. I know it's big. I am going to cum deep
  in your mouth, and you will swallow it all. “\r

  \r

  \r

  He began pumping my mouth more challengingly and demandingly. Even while I
  gagged, I could feel his juice beginning to feel in my mouth and throat, and
  then he blasted substantial, thick loads of hot cum down deep inside. My
  throat became gurgling up, and some came dripping out of my mouth.\r

  \r

  \r

  “Fuck boy, that felt fucking awesome!” Kevin said as he pulled on his
  sweatpants. We talked a short while, and he came by a couple of times to have
  a beer and blow. I liked it because every time he came over, he would do
  something on my farm for me.\r

  Enjoy more seductions\r

  I hitched a ride and found cops and Indians. \r

  \ \r

  This was really scary. I was riding with a guy from California to Texas. He
  told me he was going to deliver one car and buy two from his friend so needed
  me to drive the second car back.\r

  \ \r

  We are in Utah in the desert. It's about 2 am and I wake up with cop lights
  pulling us over. Buck, my friend, says, “keep quiet!”\r

  \ \r

  Long story short. The car was stolen and I did not know. They arrested him and
  brought me in for questioning.\r

  \ \r

  I was alone in a holding room handcuffed to the table. I remember thinking, oh
  shit what have I gotten involved with. The cop came in and told me that Buck
  informed them I knew nothing about the car. They had run my records and saw no
  criminal history so we’re going to just ask me a few questions and release me.
  I sat cuffed in the room for about 30 mins and a big cop I had not seen before
  came into the room.\r

  \ \r

  The cop said, “Buck told us you’re gay and that’s why he had you with him, to
  give him head.” I said, “yes sir and he offered me pay to drive a car from
  Texas to California.” The cop then left me cuffed, put me in his patrol car
  and he dove me into the desert.\r

  \ \r

  He pulled off the highway a little ways and stopped. He had me still cuffed
  and out of the car. He tells me to bend over the hood face down and he would
  uncuff me. I felt his cock rubbing against my ass as he held my bound wrists.
  I feel my pants were undone and he grabbed my ball and as he squeezed them
  said, “Don’t make a fucking sound!”\r

  \ \r

  He pulled my pants off and I felt his flashlight handle forced into my hole. I
  yelped as it entered me. Next, I remember hearing him unzipping his pants and
  I see his utility belt on the hood near my face. “you fags are only good for
  one thing” he said as I felt his big cock rammed in me hard. I was not in pain
  and his 7-inch cock was banged in me. He came quickly inside me as he pushed
  as deep as he could.\r

  \ \r

  I should have been pissed off but I must admit that I fucking loved it! He
  released me and drove off. I was about 10 miles from the nearest town so I
  started walking. By the way, it is cold at night in the desert. I broke a cold
  and my ass was full of cum. An old pickup truck pulled over.\r

  \ \r

  Sam said, “Hop in, I will give you a ride.” Sam was an American Indian. He was
  sexy with a muscular body and smooth skin. He had a western button-up shirt on
  and jeans. Sam asked me what happened. I told him everything. Sam said, “It’s
  because you are pretty, it was wrong but I mean it as a compliment.” Then he
  took me to his house to clean up and wait for the bus station to open.\r

  \ \r

  We arrived at his place and he lived alone. It was very clean but you could
  tell he was very poor. He was fantastic to me. I took a shower and he offered
  me his best sweats to wear. He only had a fold-out bed which he put me in. I
  immediately fell asleep. I woke up and Sam was asleep on the floor. I woke him
  and said I would behave if he wanted to sleep in the bed. He chuckled and got
  in bed saying, “I did not have to behave.”\r

  \ \r

  Sam held me and gently caressed my face as I felt his cock hard against me.
  Sam said, “You have pretty eyes” he kissed me very passionately, it didn’t
  feel like a man-on-man kiss. I was definitely the girl here. He turned me
  around on his bed so I was on my stomach face in the pillow. I remember how
  hot it was feeling his smooth skin with manly muscles on top of me.\r

  \ \r

  He has me on my knees and I moaned as he licked my hole with his tongue. I
  have been licking out before but this guy was amazing! He licked me like he
  would a woman. Sam slapped is 10 Inch cock on my ass and rubbed it over my
  swollen hole he said, “I can tell that cop was rough in you, I am going to
  show you how a real man fucks!” He did exactly that! His cock was amazing. At
  times I felt like he was riding me like a horse. Other times I was as if he
  pumped inside me in a steady slow motion for a long time. He would cum in me
  and not stop his fucking. Sam would just move me into another position and
  fuck me again. All the time he would kiss and caress me. He sucked my nipples
  and nibbled my ears. I felt as if I was his.\r

  \ \r

  Never did Sam touch my cock at all but everything else was amazing. We lost
  track of time and it was the next morning before he finished with me. It was
  the most amazing sexual experience I ever felt.\r

  \ \r

  Remember I am broke and have nobody to call for a bus ticket. I ask Sam if he
  knows of a job so I can buy a bus ticket. Sam tells me to stay at his house
  and that he has to go to work. He tells me he called his uncle and he would
  come by and talk to me about a job he might have done for some office work.
  Sam tells me his uncle, Mike, manages a Casino on the Indian Reservation.\r

  \ \r

  Mike arrives and is dressed very nicely in a western-style suit. He is a big
  guy and built. He made me feel a little nervous because you could tell he was
  dangerous when the situation called for it. Mike sits down and says, “Sam told
  me everything, even that he was with you.” I said, “really? Ok.” Mike
  continues by telling me, “Sam enjoyed Fucking you I feel a bit too much so
  this is what I will do. I will buy you a ticket and put you on a bus home.” I
  said, “I can work a day to earn the money and will not mess with Sam. I am not
  trash just because I am gay. Sam has been nothing but nice to me and I would
  never do anything that would hurt him.” Mike looked at me very hard. He sat
  back in his chair and said, “Ok, I get it, I see you clearly and you are not
  as I expected.” He stood up and walked over to me and looked down at me and
  said, “I want something for my money so I will see what your ass is like.” He
  told me this not as an offer but as a command.\r

  \ \r

  Mike was not anything like Sam. He was a big burly man. His cock was 11 inches
  and thicker than normal. He was very aggressive and angry when He threw me
  down and bent me over. My hole and swollen insides were still moist with Sam’s
  cum inside me. Mike had my ass cheeks grasped in his hands as he pulled them
  apart. His large cock he thrust in and all out of me penetrated me over and
  over. I was hot but the feeling of being violated and penetrated was
  definitely not affectionate. This was the only real-time in my life I felt
  like a whore slut.\r

  \ \r

  I remember thinking in one experience I had the best and worst event of my
  life.\r

  \ \r

  Mike changed after fucking me a while. I don’t know exactly why, maybe he saw
  I was obeying him or it felt good. He finished inside opf me without the
  violence. After Mike said, “I have to admit I have never had an ass that good
  before.” He had me dressed and drove me to the bus station. He gave me 500
  dollars and said, “You be careful and sorry I was hard on you at first.”\r

  Squeeze your hole while he’s inside you\r

  As bottoms, you obviously need to loosen your hole wide enough for him to
  insert himself inside of you. But once you're warmed up, periodically squeeze
  your hole as he's penetrating you. The pressure not only feels really good for
  him, but for you too.\r

  \r

  If you think you're an expert, think again. There's always more to be
  learned!\r

  There are plenty of more basic sex tips out there for tops and bottoms who
  want to strengthen their game in bed, but what about for the experts? If
  you’re having plenty of sex, you probably already know how to use a lot of
  lube. (Or conversely, your anus is so warmed up, you don’t even need any.) You
  also know more than three types of sexual positions. So these are some tips
  for tops/bottoms/versatile men who don’t need a 101 crash course, but a 401
  masters level seminar.\r

  \r

  \r

  Here are sex tips for gay guys who think they know everything about sex! \r

  \r

  \r

  Switch condoms between partners\r

  So hopefully you're doing this already, but if you're topping a number of guys
  (first of all, good for you), you should be switching condoms between
  partners, no matter how squeaky clean their anuses are. You don't want to
  transfer any bacteria or anything else between partners...\r

  \r

  \r

  Rule of thumb: hands should always be busy\r

  If your hands aren't doing something then you're doing something wrong. They
  can be holding on to the bedpost for dear life. They can be touching your
  partner's chest, jerking them off, holding their hand. Your hands should never
  be laying by your side doing nothing.\r

  \r

  \r

  So if you're a pro, you already know what Kegel exercises are and how they
  strengthen your PC muscle. If you're topping, do a Kegel squeeze inside of
  him. It moves your penis up and down, hitting different places, which feels
  really good for the man bottoming. \r

  Use vibrating cock rings\r

  There's really nothing much more to add than this. I've never met anyone who
  doesn't like it. It feels good for the top, helping him to achieve a more
  full-body orgasm, and it feels really good for the bottom, because you're
  vibrating his booty. It's just a win-win, and I'm surprised why more guys
  aren't using them all the damn time. \r

  Dating Tips for Gay Introverts \r

  \r

  \r

  Spread those cheeks wide before devouring his hole\r

  WIDE. None of this baby spread nonsense. You want to get up IN there. Pull his
  cheeks apart as far as they go before feasting on that cake. \r

  What to Do If You're Not Kink-Compatible Change up locations\r

  Are you a pro or are you a pro? Pros don't have sex in the bedroom every
  single time. They take their lovemaking sessions to the living room, laundry
  room, outdoors, and even sex clubs.\r

  \r

  \r

  Breathe\r

  Such a simple thing to do, and it's advice that every sex expert gives, yet I
  find myself (and so many others) getting so excited that they forget to
  breathe during sex. Breath control helps you manage your orgasms (and can
  delay them). So it's particularly good to pay attention to breath if you have
  a tendency to get a little too excited and ejaculate prematurely.  \r

  If you're a pro, you should know to give direct, explicit feedback too. \"That
  feels good. Do more of that!\" But there's also the more subtle feedback,
  which some guys prefer to receive. Moan loudly if he does something you like
  while blowing you. Arch your hips so he hits the spot you want him to hit.
  Guide his hands where you want them to These are ways to communicate what you
  want sexually without being blunt.\r

  In general, people kiss the way they like being kissed. If they use a lot of
  tongue, they want tongue in return. If they're deepthroating your dick, that's
  probably how they like receiving oral. Sometimes this isn't the case, as subs
  prefer doms, not other subs, but if you're not engaging in a play that is
  supposed to have a power discrepancy, this is a good general rule to live
  by.\r

  \r

  \r

  Double your foreplay time and tease\r

  Maybe you're already good about this, but I'm just going to go off on a limb
  and assume you're not. I, too, have a tendency of wanting to get down to
  business ASAP, but when I have more foreplay, more kissing, and more teasing
  prior to getting down to business, the sex is so much better.\r

  HIV prevention interventions exist for gay male couples in the U.S., \r

  Yet estimates indicate that between one- and two-thirds of U.S. men who have
  sex with men acquire HIV while in a primary relationship (e.g., gay male
  couples). In response to these statistics, research has been conducted to
  better understand gay male couples’ relationships, including their sexual
  agreements. Many gay male couples in the U.S. establish a sexual agreement,
  which is an explicit mutual understanding between two main partners about what
  sexual and other behaviors they agree to engage in and with whom while in the
  relationship. Although some research about sexual agreements has been
  conducted, little is known on whether aspects of gay male couples’ sexual
  agreements (e.g., establishment, type, and adherence) vary as a function of
  their relationship length. The present study aimed to fulfill this gap of
  knowledge, which may lead to a better understanding of how agreements can be
  used for developing HIV/STI prevention interventions. A national,
  cross-sectional, Internet-based study was used to collect dyadic data from 361
  US gay male couples. Men in each couple completed the questionnaire
  independently. All analyses were employed at the couple-level. Our findings
  showed that the longer the couples had been in their relationship, the more
  likely they would concur about having a sexual agreement. As relationship
  length increased, the proportion of couples who disagreed about their current
  agreement type increased. No direct trend was found for recent adherence to an
  agreement; however, the likelihood of ever breaking an agreement increased as
  relationship length increased. Findings from this study indicate there is a
  need to help gay male couples’ establish and maintain their agreements,
  particularly for those who are in their early formative stages, as well as,

  A Big Favor\r

  I am waiting at Andy’s front door, wondering why I am there.  His phone call
  to me had been cryptic, to say the least. All I know is that my long-time
  buddy needs me for some kind of favor. I protested that it was late, but he
  said it would be worth your while, so now here I am.\r

  He opens the door, looking nervous. “Hey Tom, thanks for coming.”\r

  “No problem,” I replied, as I was stepping inside I said “Happy to help
  out.”  He had a odd look as he said,\r

  “Um, yeah, thanks for coming,”   He seemed very distracted.\r

  “You okay?”  asked, showing concern for my friend. “Is something wrong?”\r

  “Nah, nothing like that,” he reassures me as we make our way to the living
  room. “Want a beer?”\r

  “Sure,” I replied, and sat down on the couch.\r

  Andy returns with two beers and you clink them together. “Cheers.”\r

  “So where’s Nick tonight?” I ask in what you hope is an off-hand manner. One
  of the reasons I agreed to come out at this late hour was the chance of seeing
  him, his lover was really sexy. You really like Andy. And Really, really, like
  his hot lover too.\r

  Andy coughs. “Uh, he is here. In the shower at the moment.”\r

  “Uh huh,” you reply casually, picturing him naked and wet, wishing you could
  be his loofah.\r

  “He's kind of why I asked you here,” he continues, avoiding your gaze for some
  reason. “We need something. I just hope that it isn’t going to be too much to
  ask.”\r

  I say “ok.”  Andy tells me “We’re moving fucking furniture again, aren’t
  we?  I replied “You know, it’s a lot easier if he empties his crap out of it
  first — you’ve told him that, right?”\r

  Andy takes a big swig of beer. “Off topic, Look, if I tell you something, will
  you keep it a secret?”\r

  “Sure,” I agree, intrigued.\r

  “Okay. Look, this is hard for me to say, but I trust you Tom, okay? I trust
  you.” He pauses, then continues. “I can trust you, right?”\r

  “Dude,” I reply, my tone implying that he is silly to ask.\r

  That seems to satisfy him. “Okay. The thing is, you probably won’t believe
  this, but I'm not that great in bed, to be honest.”\r

  You were about to take another swig of beer, but you froze, the bottle half
  lifted to your face. “what?”\r

  “I’m shit in bed, man. Can’t keep it up,” he continues, staring at the
  floor.\r

  “You can’t keep it up? With Nick?” you say incredulously.\r

  “Yeah. It’s getting bad, Tom. Everything else is great, but I just can’t
  satisfy him in bed. I think he’s going to leave me,” says Andy sadly.\r

  Your heart goes out to him. “That sucks, man.”\r

  “I dunno what the problem is,” he continues. ``He's hot, right?“\r

  You think, all things considered, that it’s safe to agree. “Yeah, he’s pretty
  hot.”\r

  “I just don’t understand. Premature ejaculation. you could understand that,
  right? Because he’s so hot.”\r

  “Yeah.”\r

  “It was good at the start, but I just can’t get it up any more. He's
  definitely going to leave me.”\r

  My heart bleeds for him. To have a lover as sexy as Nick, and be unable to
  take advantage. It must really suck.\r

  “Have you seen anyone about this?” I ask. “Perhaps if you saw a therapist,
  they could work out what’s going on with you.”\r

  Andy shakes his head and comprehensively shuts you down. “I did that. I don’t
  want to talk about it.”\r

  “Okay, well, there’s other things you can do to satisfy him. You know, like
  oral sex.”\r

  He flinches. “Ugh, no thanks!”\r

  I looked at him disbelievingly. “Not even to save your relationship.” I was
  also thinking he must be crazy. \r

  “Ugh, no! I just can’t!”\r

  You’re taken aback at his unwillingness to go down on his sexy lover, You’ve
  always imagined his cock to be quite lovely and tasty. “You do like guys,
  right?”\r

  “Of course I do!” he bristles, before draining the last of his beer. There’s a
  long silence.\r

  “So, is that why I’m here? Do you need someone to talk to?” I ask
  tentatively.\r

  “Nah dude. Nick and I talked about it, and we thought that maybe we could make
  it work if I let him fuck someone else occasionally. He suggested it to
  you.”\r

  Whoa. You didn’t see that one coming. He timed it just as you were taking
  another sip of your beer, and it went down the wrong way. You choke for a good
  ten seconds, tears streaming down your face.\r

  Andy waits patiently for you to recover.\r

  “He suggested it to me?” you finally splutter.\r

  “Yeah. Don’t ask me why,” he replies. “So, are you up for it?”\r

  You look around. You can’t see any cameras, but they’re pretty small these
  days, so who can tell? You study Andy’s face, looking for some indication that
  this is all a joke, or worse, a trap. He appears sincere.\r

  “Do you need this to save your relationship?” you ask warily.\r

  “Yeah. Nick needs a good lay. It’s been a long time for him,” he replies
  earnestly.\r

  You pause for what you think is enough time to convince him that you’re
  actually reluctant, before cautiously agreeing. “Dude, I don’t want to see you
  two break up. So if I can help out, then sure. I’d do anything to help you
  out. You know that.”\r

  He rolls his eyes. “Tom, I know you’ve always wanted to fuck my lover, so you
  can stop pretending!”\r

  You grin, realizing how transparent you must be. “Yeah, but you know I’d never
  make a move on him, right?”\r

  “I know. And just so we’re clear, he’s still mine. You’re just going to fuck
  him, okay?”\r

  “Fine by me,” you agree. You’ve fantasized about Nick a lot, but none of those
  fantasies involved picking out wallpaper patterns or having lunch with his
  parents.\r

  “Let’s shake on it,” Andy proposes, reaching out his hand.\r

  You shake, and the deal is done. “So when were you wanting me to do the
  deed?”\r

  “How about now?” comes a voice from behind you. You spin on the couch to find
  Nick standing in the doorway, his body wrapped to mid-thigh in a wet towel.\r

  You look him in the eyes, trying to get a read on his expression. After a
  second he suffers a brief loss of confidence and diverts his gaze down, before
  visibly deciding “to hell with it” and straightening up proudly, looking right
  back at you with his hands on his cock and saying “ok do me yes? Or no?\r

  \r

  \r

  I smile, knowing that your conversation with Andy has revealed the perfect way
  to break the ice. “Come here Nick. I think I know exactly what you need!”\r

  He enters the room and walks around the couch to stand in front of you, while
  you stay seated. “And what would that be?” he asks, excitement plainly visible
  on his face.\r

  You reach forward and tug at the towel. Nick makes no attempt to catch it as
  it unravels and drops to the floor at his feet. You can’t help but gasp
  slightly as you take your first look at his nude form, and my smile broadens
  into a stupid grin. Everything about him, hips and thighs, his chest, belly
  and his smooth tan skin, it is as I had dreamed and hoped. Amazingly you’ve
  skipped all the usual pleasantries in less than thirty seconds and suddenly
  found yourself at eye-level with Nick’s sweet-looking cock.  This is going to
  be fun.\r

  “Put your leg up on the couch,” you suggest, and he complies, revealing every
  intimate inch of that secret area between his legs. You shift position so that
  your face is mere inches from his cock, and you take him by the hips, enjoying
  the feel of his hard, still-slightly-damp body under your palms. To my delight
  you discover that he does, in fact, smell of soap and man musk.  \r

  The magic of the moment is broken by Andy. “You’ve shaved,” he says to him,
  sounding surprised.\r

  “Mmm hmm,” replies Nick. “I feel so naughty being trimmed down there. Do you
  like it, Tom?”\r

  You lean in and lick the tip of his cock. delighting in the smooth feel
  against your lips. “Very sexy,” you say encouragingly.\r

  “It doesn’t normally look like that,” protests Andy, but you just roll your
  eyes at him before burying your face between Nick’s thighs.\r

  You probe him with your tongue, slithering it up and down him and periodically
  lashing his ball. Almost immediately he starts to gently moan and sigh,
  gripping your head in his hands to pull you to choke. As you swallow him, your
  hands roam around his hips and ass, gently squeezing and stroking the curves
  of that hot ass. Soon Nick’s crotch is wet with precum and his own juices. I
  was making some very sloppy-sounding noises as I went down on him.\r

  “Oh yes, Tom, right there,”   he sighs.\r

  You double your efforts — sucking his nether lips into your mouth, then my
  tongue was exploring his cock from end to end, but always remembering to come
  back to deep swallow him. I can hear his breathing quicken and his unbent leg
  begins to shake. You dig your fingers into his asscheeks and make rapid
  circles Twisting my head from side to side, occasionally sucking on it hard.\r

  “Oh… oh… !” Nick moans, and words cannot express how sexy he sounds while he’s
  doing it. His leg wobbles more and he falls forward against you, held up by
  one hand on the back of the couch and his in my mouth. “Oh… oh… oh my
  God!”  he cries, surprised and delighted, and his whole body vibrates in your
  hands. He's pushing your face down on his cock as hard as he can, and you give
  up on breathing for the moment, focussing on getting him over the line. You
  keep munching away all through his orgasm, until hypersensitivity strikes and
  load after load of hot Cum fills my mouth.  he collapses into your lap.\r

  “Oh wow,” he pants. You glance over at Andy with a smug expression and raise
  my eyebrows, as if to say “that wasn’t so hard, was it?”\r

  He’s looking back at you with a strange expression you can’t read. It can’t be
  easy watching your friend sucking your lover, after all.\r

  “Is that what you needed, hon?” he eventually asks.\r

  “It’s a good start,” Nick replies. He's become aware of your raging boner
  pressing against his bare ass and he’s reached down to grab it through your
  pants. “I still want this cock inside me!”\r

  You can see that he’s looking conflicted. “You don’t have to watch,” you
  suggest helpfully.\r

  He smiles ruefully. “Keep going. Give him what he needs.”\r

  Nick twists in your lap and gives you a deep kiss, most likely tasting himself
  on your lips. Then he pulls back and looks at you playfully. “Take me to bed!”
  he orders, climbing off your lap.\r

  You get up, your massive erection plainly evident, and direct a parting shrug
  at Andy before following Nick’s sexy ass as it sashays delightfully down the
  corridor.\r

  \r

  \r

  Nick practically runs the last few feet to the bedroom, and you hurry to keep
  up with him. Once inside, he throws herself on the bed, then twists and
  shuffles to a seated position on the edge of the mattress, looking up at you
  with undisguised desire.\r

  “Let me get this dick out,” he giggles. You stand between her parted knees,
  your bulge practically in his face, and he starts fumbling with your belt. You
  untuck your shirt and start rapidly undoing your buttons, finally tossing it
  to the floor just as your pants fall to your ankles. You try to extract your
  feet from your pants but your shoes get stuck.\r

  Nick reaches out and grasps your prick through your underpants, feeling the
  shape of your shaft and your balls in her palm. “My God, Tom, I’ve wanted to
  get my hands on this for so long!”\r

  You almost reply that you’ve been thinking about his ass for an equally long
  time, but decide against it, not wanting to make the conversation
  unnecessarily, Instead you continue trying unsuccessfully to shuffle your feet
  through your pant legs.\r

  Nick tugs your underpants down and your cock springs out. He gasps in delight
  and wraps his hand around the shaft, gently tugging you. “It’s wonderful, Tom.
  So much bigger than Andy’s!” he marvels. “I just hope I can take it!”\r

  he leans in, and you think he might be about to take you into his mouth, but
  she deflects and kisses the underside instead. You cringe a little. Hey, it’s
  been a long day, and you had no idea it might end in a blowjob. Next time
  you’ll shower first.\r

  Nick looks up at you. “Tom, I don’t want any foreplay. I just want this
  beautiful cock inside me. And you don’t need to be gentle!”\r

  His words inflame your passions and I struggle frantically to free yourself
  from those infernal pants. Your shoes are still stuck but you manage to pull
  your feet out of them, finally kicking the tangled mess aside. Remembering
  that a naked man in socks is not a good look, you tug them off too, while Nick
  settles back on the bed and spreads his legs wide. Then you throw yourself on
  top of him, your stiff prick sandwiched between your body and her bald ass.\r

  There’s some frenzied rummaging around as you both attempt to grab your cock
  and guide it home. You feel your knob slithering up and down his hot ass,
  before settling at his entrance. he grabs your ass tightly with both hands and
  pulls you in, and your cock sinks slowly and inexorably into his tight tunnel,
  which stretches and enfolds your cock, like the waves of the ocean submitting
  to the bow of a newly-Christened ship as it glides down the slipway.\r

  “Oh wow, it’s been so long since I’ve had a decent-sized cock inside me!”
  sighs Nick.\r

  There’s a cough from behind you and you twist back to see Andy standing in the
  open doorway. He can’t have enjoyed overhearing his lover besmirching his
  penis size.\r

  “Does he have to be here?” you ask Nick as you begin thrusting, feeling his
  ass loosen up to accommodate the repeated incursion of your turgid invader.\r

  “Let him stay,” he pants, “he might learn something.” Then he addresses her
  boyfriend. “Andy, don’t just stand there like an idiot! Come and sit down if
  you’re staying!”\r

  You shake your head in disbelief as your buddy comes over and sits on the edge
  of the bed, barely a foot away from where you’re fucking his man. It’s a small
  comfort that he seems to be entranced with the rapturous expressions on his
  face, rather than me rapidly humping ass.\r

  You decide to ignore him as best you can, staring into Nick’s eyes and groping
  his nipples as you fuck her, your ballsack slapping against the lower parts of
  his butt cheeks. His hands roam over your back, scratching at you with his
  fingers,but they keep returning to grab lustily at your ass.\r

  “Oh Andy, he’s so big! It feels so fucking good,” moans Nick.\r

  You smile to yourself. You would never have described your cock as especially
  big, but Nick is really tight, his ass evidently untroubled by anything of
  decent size up to now.\r

  “Fuck him harder,” suggests Andy.\r

  “Hey, no offense, but I’d appreciate it if you could maybe keep quiet,” you
  grunt in reply. You feel like he’s crossing a boundary somehow.\r

  “Sorry,” he grumbles.\r

  You bury your face in Nick’s neck, kissing and nibbling your way up to his
  ear, while he writhes around underneath you. Taking Andy’s advice you step up
  the force and frequency of your thrusting, pounding Nick’s ass like you’ve
  pounded no man before.\r

  “Uh, uh, uh,” he grunts and moans under the onslaught, his breath hot on your
  shoulder. “Fuck me, keep fucking me! Oh God, I can’t believe Tom’s actually
  fucking me!”\r

  It’s wonderful to hear how much he’s been looking forward to this. It makes
  you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.\r

  “I want to see you cum,” Nick pants. “I want to see you shoot all over me.”\r

  You moan and draw on all your reserves of energy, your hips slapping hard
  against him as you enter the home straight.\r

  “Cum for you Nick,” you whisper into his ear. “Cum now, so I can cum too. I’m
  gonna cover you in cum!”\r

  Nick gives out a little whimper, then his eyes widen and he lets out a
  tortured, orgasmic cry. His body wriggles under yours and you feel his ass
  walls twitching around your deeply-buried rod. You’ve managed to get him hot
  with ass penetration, and probably in record time, too. Well done, you.\r

  You keep fucking into Nick all through his ass was tight still. Then a
  familiar feeling starts to wash over you and you force yourself to pull your
  cock out of him. You quickly get to your knees between his legs and take your
  cock in your hand, wanking it furiously while he stares at it with enraptured
  anticipation.\r

  With an almighty groan you let loose. Your rapidly-pumping fist flings your
  milky seed at Nick, spattering his stomach and chest. One thick glob lands on
  his face.\r

  “Jesus,” mutters Andy, clambering off the bed to get clear.\r

  I milk out the last drops and feed it to him. Nick reaches down and runs his
  fingers through your semen, then moves on to gently rub his cock with his
  gooey fingertips.\r

  “Thank you, Tom. Thank you so much,” he whispers.\r

  You look down at Nick’s beautiful nude body, artfully decorated with the
  previous contents of your balls.\r

  “Don’t mention it,” you reply.\r

  Andy moves in and sits on the bed next to her, stroking his hair. You move
  aside awkwardly, then climb off the bed and busy yourself with trying to make
  sense of your inside-out pants and the shoes stuck inside.\r

  “Was that what you wanted?” you hear him quietly ask him.\r

  “Yes babe,” she replies. “Thank you so much for letting me do this.”\r

  He leans over and kisses him, careful to avoid getting your cum on him, and he
  reciprocates with a passionate, tongue-twisting smooch that lasts for long
  enough for you to get dressed.\r

  “So, I might get going…” you suggest awkwardly.\r

  Andy looks back at you. “We’ll catch up soon, yeah?”\r

  “Sure,” you reply.\r

  He hesitates, then looks at Nick. he nods.\r

  “And, uh… we might do this again, if that’s okay by you,” he suggests.\r

  You grin. “No problem. You know where to find me, buddy!”\r

  \r

  \r

  ### A Challenge and Lesson in Love\r

  \r

  \r

  You lied to me, and I can't accept that. I've told you countless times to be
  honest, yet you continue to deceive. For example, you told someone I wasn't
  your boyfriend, so I made it true. You don't follow through on your promises,
  and despite being told a thousand times that I value honesty above all else,
  you still fail to deliver. You claim it’s about exploring before settling
  down, but if those behaviors mean more to you than losing me, then you deserve
  the consequences.\r

  \r

  \r

  The truth is simple: you take me for granted until I’m no longer there. I’ve
  always been there for you, but I only have you when it’s convenient for you.
  Until I can trust your words, you’re not the man to whom I can entrust my
  soul, heart, mind, and body for a happy, complete life. I’m not perfect, but I
  don’t continually mislead or fail to prove my worth. I can’t worship a man in
  my heart who embodies disrespect, dishonesty, and unreasonable behavior. Your
  aggressive, unfair obligations and standards, jealousy, and manipulative
  tendencies are unacceptable.\r

  \r

  \r

  Your cries for help are met with compliance and then dismissal. My feelings
  only matter to you if they significantly impact you, except when they hurt me.
  You tell others lies and spread misinformation to avoid embarrassment or gain
  favor at my expense. You hold love in your hand, a love most people never come
  close to experiencing, yet you treat it as something to be taken for
  granted.\r

  \r

  \r

  Your feelings and heart are impossible to give fully if all you do is take.
  You use what you give later as control or to balance shortfalls. I could go
  on, but I’ve waited for you to show an attempt to improve. You’ve done many
  things right and changed in ways that almost make things better. It breaks my
  heart with joy, and I want to run and cuddle in your arms. But the underlying
  truth is, you must want my happiness in love for you more than anything.\r

  \r

  \r

  Can you do that and still not be trusted? No. You use lies and excuses,
  bullying and blaming me for unmet needs, then displaying the negative behavior
  you’ve asked me to adopt. I even hear your lies coming from others. This tells
  me that you need to meet me on my terms. You must learn that you are only my
  love because I bend and compromise. You can’t even tell me something and be
  believed. I can do amazing things as your equal lover, even extreme actions,
  but if you want the right to be the man I love and would die for, I must be
  your goal—not something that waits until you’ve accomplished some sexual
  conquest.\r

  \r

  \r

  I give you what you give me. If I give in to what you ask without trust, I
  lose. If you come to me from time to time without lies and show love, passion,
  and a need for love from me, and then get your perverse cravings done without
  hurting me, you might get your fictional fantasies out of your system. If
  you’re not too late, if you can earn my trust and if I still live, open your
  heart and pledge to make me yours because you love me. Then I will be yours,
  no matter what.\r

  \r

  \r

  You will possibly succeed if you realize what you had when you lose my touch
  and support. Come for my heart, earn my trust with real, true confessions, and
  fulfill your promises. Only then will I gladly be all yours again—but not
  before.\r

  \r

  \r

  Advice and Reflections \r

  Another question I was asked was, “What advice do you give?” That’s easy! Live
  each day in a way that you can sleep with a clear conscience and make sure
  that each day you do something to improve somebody else’s life. I have always
  lived that way, and it has mostly worked for me.\r

  \r

  \r

  I hope you enjoyed and found this book useful. With 50 years of active
  experience and 25 years of being monogamous, I have a lot to share. I can go
  on a date with men if I ask permission, but I have only had 5 dates other than
  my lover in all these years. Out of those dates, I only messed around with 3
  men. One I really liked but he lied about his age, so I left immediately. One
  was just a buddy, married, who wanted to learn how to be fisted. No sexual
  interaction between us. One hot, sexy 30-year-old I banged in a hotel. My
  lover was not happy, but he was so hot I couldn’t say no. I came home and
  confessed immediately. It was just before my stroke 3 years ago.\r

  \r

  \r

  To recap, it’s our 25th anniversary. The following note I slipped under his
  pillow.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### My Long-Term Lover and Our 25th Anniversary\r

  \r

  \r

  **Harry,**\r

  \r

  \r

  Here’s a message from the sincerest part of my being to let you know that
  there’s nothing in this world that I value more than your love. You are all I
  fantasize about every moment I spend alone. You’re the rarest and most special
  gift of life to me, and I could ever ask for. Baby, you know that there’s
  nothing that can ever erase the love my heart holds for you. As each day
  passes by, my feelings for you keep increasing. Suffice it to say that my love
  for you grows on a per-second basis. There’s rarely a minute I go through
  without thinking about us. You have captured my heart in a way no one else has
  ever done. Here’s a message from me to let you know that you’re a dream come
  true in my life. You’re one person that knows the deepest part of my heart,
  where my love for you lies. I don’t remember the exact words to use, but I
  wish you could see beyond the physical. I hope you can see that your love
  takes my soul to a realm that knows only love and happiness. Sweetheart, you
  can surely tell that I can hardly go through a whole day without setting my
  mind’s eyes on you. Although we were not born together, I have realized that
  we were specially created for each other. And that is the very reason our
  souls are compatible. I adore you much more than I can find words to tell you.
  You’re the same person that makes me see the beauty of love. In you, I see
  everything a man needs to be happy in a relationship. I am sure that you will
  be one of the most blessed people. I say this because I am a massive
  beneficiary of your goodness. Baby, here’s a message from my heart telling you
  that I will always love you. I can’t wait to enjoy your company, talk to you,
  smile at you, touch your hands and shoulders, and look into your eyes to see
  myself in them. You have opened my heart and soul to you only. I hope to share
  my feelings, dreams, and life with you. I am for you, my love, and I will wait
  for you anytime you like. I send magic kisses to your sweet lips to taste
  their sweetness. I wish and pray that this beautiful and fantastic bond of
  ours keeps us together as long as we live. I still love you so much after all
  these years. I hope you have a splendid night’s rest and wake up to this
  letter.\r

  love because I bend and compromise. You can’t even tell me something and be
  believed. I can do amazing things as your equal lover, even extreme actions,
  but if you want the right to be the man I love and would die for, I must be
  your goal—not something that waits until you’ve accomplished some sexual
  conquest.\r

  \r

  \r

  I give you what you give me. If I give in to what you ask without trust, I
  lose. If you come to me from time to time without lies and show love, passion,
  and a need for love from me, and then get your perverse cravings done without
  hurting me, you might get your fictional fantasies out of your system. If
  you’re not too late, if you can earn my trust and if I still live, open your
  heart and pledge to make me yours because you love me. Then I will be yours,
  no matter what.\r

  \r

  \r

  You will possibly succeed if you realize what you had when you lose my touch
  and support. Come for my heart, earn my trust​\r

  Maintaining a Double Life\r

  It's an interesting and complex dynamic you're considering and maintaining a
  relationship where you’re aware of its limitations or illusions, while also
  pursuing a more authentic, grounded life. This kind of dual existence can be
  both liberating and challenging. Let's explore some of the possibilities and
  considerations:\r

  \r

  \r

  1. **Defining Boundaries:**\r

  \   - **Emotional Boundaries:** Clearly distinguish between the emotional
  investment you allow in your “deluded” relationship versus your real life.
  This might involve accepting that certain emotional needs won’t be met within
  the deluded relationship, and seeking fulfillment elsewhere.\r

  \   - **Time Management:** Decide how much time and energy you’re willing to
  allocate to this relationship. It’s important to ensure it doesn’t overshadow
  or interfere with your real life.\r

  \r

  \r

  2. **Compartmentalization:**\r

  \   - **Mental Separation:** You’ll need to compartmentalize your life—keeping
  the “deluded” aspects in one box and your real life in another. This can help
  maintain clarity and prevent the emotional spillover that could cause
  distress.\r

  \   - **Cognitive Dissonance Management:** Be prepared to manage the cognitive
  dissonance that comes from living two parallel lives. This involves being
  aware of the contradictions but choosing to embrace them for different
  purposes.\r

  \r

  \r

  3. **Personal Fulfillment:**\r

  \   - **Authentic Relationships:** Ensure that your real life includes
  authentic, fulfilling relationships that meet your deeper needs. This way, the
  deluded relationship doesn’t become a source of disappointment or
  frustration.\r

  \   - **Personal Growth:** Engage in activities and relationships in your real
  life that contribute to your personal growth, self-respect, and well-being.
  This balance can make the deluded relationship less impactful on your overall
  happiness.\r

  \r

  \r

  4. **Communication Strategy:**\r

  \   - **With Yourself:** Be honest with yourself about why you’re maintaining
  the deluded relationship. Understanding your motivations can help you manage
  it more effectively.\r

  \   - **With the Other Person:** Depending on the dynamics, you might choose
  to keep certain things unsaid in the deluded relationship, or you might set
  expectations that align with the reality you both are willing to live with.\r

  \r

  \r

  5. **Risks and Rewards:**\r

  \   - **Emotional Risks:** There’s a risk of the deluded relationship
  eventually bleeding into your real life, causing emotional turmoil or
  confusion. It’s crucial to monitor your feelings and ensure they remain under
  control.\r

  \   - **Enjoyment:** On the flip side, the deluded relationship might offer
  you a kind of escapism or enjoyment that is hard to find elsewhere. If managed
  well, it could serve as a harmless indulgence.\r

  \r

  \r

  6. **Long-Term Considerations:**\r

  \   - **Endgame:** Think about where this path might lead in the long term.
  Will you eventually need to choose between the two lives, or can you sustain
  both indefinitely? Being prepared for possible outcomes will help you navigate
  this dual existence more smoothly.\r

  \r

  \r

  7. **Ethical Considerations:**\r

  \   - **Honesty vs. Deception:** Consider the ethical implications of
  maintaining a deluded relationship. Even if it’s understood by both parties,
  it’s worth reflecting on how this aligns with your values and integrity.\r

  \r

  \r

  By exploring these aspects, you can better understand whether and how you
  might balance a deluded relationship with your real life. It’s all about
  creating a structure where you feel fulfilled without losing yourself in
  either world. \r

  Lesson for open relationships\r

  \r

  \r

  To make an open relationship partner who loves you feel secure, consider the
  following steps:\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 1. **Establish Clear Communication:**\r

  \   - **Regular Check-Ins:** Have regular conversations about how each of you
  is feeling in the relationship. This can help identify any concerns or
  insecurities early on.\r

  \   - **Set Boundaries:** Clearly define what is acceptable and what is not in
  the relationship. This helps avoid misunderstandings and creates a sense of
  safety.\r

  \   - **Be Honest and Transparent:** Share your feelings and experiences
  openly. Honesty about your actions and emotions builds trust.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 2. **Show Consistent Affection:**\r

  \   - **Share Experiences:** Be open about your experiences with other
  partners, within the boundaries you've set. This transparency helps prevent

  how the open relationship operates. Their input should matter in setting
  boundaries and rules.\r

  \   - **Discuss Encounters:** If they are comfortable with it, discuss your
  encounters with others. This transparency can help mitigate insecurities.\r

  \r

  ### 10. **Regularly Reevaluate the Relationship:**\r

  you've set to ensure they still work for both of you.\r

  \   - **Adapt as Needed:** Be willing to adapt and change aspects of the open
  relationship if it helps both partners feel more secure and happy.\r

  \   - **Celebrate Progress:** Acknowledge and celebrate the progress you've
  made together in navigating the open relationship. \r

  \r

  \r

  By consistently applying these strategies, you can create a secure, loving
  environment for your partner in an open relationship. This approach fosters
  trust, respect, and emotional intimacy, which are crucial for maintaining a
  healthy and balanced connection.\r

  \r

  \r

  ‘Just as important’\r

  \r

  \r

  To support your open relationship partner who is more active in sleeping
  around and to show that you are not hurt by their actions, consider the
  following steps:\r

  \r

  \r

  your partner know how you feel and encourage them to share their experiences
  without fear of judgment.\r

  \   - **Ask About Their Experiences:** Show genuine interest in their

  understand and respect their desire for variety and exploration. Make it clear
  that you’re supportive of their choices.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 2. **Set Clear Boundaries and Respect Them:**\r

  \   - **Revisit Boundaries Together:** Regularly discuss and revisit the
  boundaries of your open relationship to ensure both partners feel comfortable
  and secure.\r

  \   - **Respect Their Space:** Allow them the freedom to explore without
  making them feel guilty or restrained. Respecting their autonomy helps them
  feel trusted and secure.\r

  \   - **Avoid Over-Interrogating:** Avoid making them feel like they’re being
  questioned or interrogated about their activities. Keep the conversations
  light and positive.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 3. **Provide Emotional Support:**\r

  \   - **Offer Emotional Availability:** Let them know they can talk to you
  about their experiences, good or bad, without you taking it personally.\r

  \   - **Be a Safe Space:** Create a supportive environment where they can
  express their feelings, doubts, or concerns without fear of hurting you.\r

  \   - **Celebrate Their Happiness:** Show genuine happiness for them when they
  have positive experiences with others. Celebrate their joy without letting
  jealousy show.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 4. **Show Confidence in the Relationship:**\r

  relationship and that you trust them. Confidence in your connection can help
  them feel more at ease with their actions.\r

  with others.\r

  \   - **Avoid Showing Insecurity:** Even if you occasionally feel insecure,

  and reassurance.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 5. **Create Positive Experiences Together:**\r

  \   - **Plan Special Times:** Make an effort to plan and enjoy special moments
  together that are just for the two of you. This reinforces your unique bond.\r

  both enjoy.\r

  \   - **Keep the Romance Alive:** Maintain a romantic and sexual connection
  that’s fulfilling and satisfying, showing that you’re invested in the
  relationship.\r

  \r

  ### 6. **Encourage Their Exploration:**\r

  \   - **Express Encouragement:** Verbally encourage them to enjoy their
  exploration and experiences, showing that you support their journey.\r

  \   - **Avoid Jealousy Triggers:** Avoid expressing jealousy or resentment
  about their activities. Show that you’re confident and content in your own
  space within the relationship.\r

  \   - **Share Your Own Exploration (If Applicable):** If you’re also exploring
  the open relationship, share your own experiences in a way that’s open and
  honest, which can make the situation feel more balanced.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 7. **Be Reassuring and Playful:**\r

  \   - **Use Humor:** Use humor to keep things light. Playfully acknowledge
  their adventures, showing that you can talk about these topics without taking
  them too seriously.\r

  words that you don’t feel possessive or controlling over them. This reinforces
  the open nature of your relationship.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 8. **Focus on Emotional Intimacy:**\r

  \   - **Maintain Emotional Connection:** Ensure that you maintain a strong
  emotional connection, which can be more important than physical exclusivity.
  Deep conversations, shared experiences, and emotional support help build
  this.\r

  \   - **Share Your Life:** Involve them in your life, share stories, and keep
  them in the loop about what you’re up to, fostering a sense of closeness
  beyond physical encounters.\r

  \   - **Express Love in Different Forms:** Show your love and care through
  words, actions, and affection, reinforcing that your bond is unique and
  valued.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 9. **Practice Self-Care and Independence:**\r

  Show that you have a fulfilling life outside the relationship, which can make
  them feel less pressured.\r

  you’re emotionally balanced and can handle the complexities of an open
  relationship with grace.\r

  \   - **Reflect on Your Own Feelings:** Regularly reflect on your own feelings
  and needs, so you can communicate effectively and avoid letting insecurities
  build up.\r

  \r

  \r

  ### 10. **Regularly Reaffirm Your Commitment:**\r

  \   - **Verbal Reassurance:** Reassure them that you’re happy and content with
  the open relationship. Let them know that their actions don’t change how you
  feel about them.\r

  place on your relationship and that you’re in it for the unique connection you
  share.\r

  \   - **Be Patient and Understanding:** Understand that this dynamic can bring
  up unexpected emotions. Be patient with both yourself and them as you navigate
  the open relationship together.\r

  \r

  \r

  By focusing on these steps, you can help your partner feel secure and
  supported in an open relationship. The goal is to foster a sense of trust,
  openness, and mutual respect, allowing both partners to enjoy the relationship
  fully without unnecessary stress or insecurity\r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \ **Conclusion: The Journey Forward**\r

  \r

  \r

  As I sit here reflecting on everything I’ve shared—every story, every lesson,
  and every relationship—I can’t help but smile at the journey that’s brought me
  to this moment. It’s a journey that hasn’t always been easy, but one that has
  shaped me into the person I am today—someone who understands the beauty of
  love, the power of self-worth, and the importance of connection.\r

  \r

  \r

  Looking back, I see a life filled with so much more than the ups and downs of
  romance. There have been triumphs, losses, and revelations that go far beyond
  the surface of sexual chemistry or fleeting moments of passion. I’ve learned
  that true success, both in love and life, doesn’t come from a perfect
  relationship or a flawless career. It comes from the way we navigate the highs
  and lows, the way we pick ourselves up when things fall apart, and most
  importantly, the way we cherish the people we meet along the way.\r

  \r

  \r

  Through every letter, every encounter, and every chapter of this book, I’ve
  come to realize that life is not a destination; it’s an ongoing journey. One
  where we continue to grow, evolve, and rediscover ourselves over and over
  again. Love is the same. It’s not something that stays static—it transforms,
  deepens, and sometimes fades, only to return in new and unexpected ways.\r

  \r

  \r

  If there’s one thing I hope readers take away from this book, it’s the idea
  that **love and life are both a practice**. Whether you’re navigating
  relationships, exploring your own identity, or simply trying to figure out
  what success means to you, it’s all part of the same practice—one that
  requires patience, courage, and a good sense of humor.\r

  \r

  \r

  I’ve learned that it’s okay to make mistakes, to have encounters that are
  messy or imperfect. It’s okay to laugh at yourself, to acknowledge when things
  don’t go as planned, and to embrace the unpredictability of life. In fact,
  those moments are often the ones that teach us the most. The lessons aren’t
  always obvious, but they’re always there, waiting for us to discover them.\r

  \r

  \r

  So where do we go from here? \r

  \r

  \r

  We continue to embrace the unknown. We keep learning. We keep loving—whether
  that love is for a partner, a friend, or ourselves. We choose, every day, to
  be open to the possibilities that life offers, even when it scares us. We take
  pride in who we are and what we bring to the world, knowing that we are worthy
  of the love, success, and joy we seek.\r

  \r

  \r

  And as for me? I’m still learning. I’m still growing. And I’m still excited to
  see what life has in store. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s
  that the best moments often come when we least expect them. So I’m ready for
  the next chapter, whatever that may be.\r

  \r

  \r

  For those of you who’ve read these pages and found something that resonates,
  know that this journey isn’t just mine—it’s yours too. Whether you’re in the
  midst of navigating relationships or simply figuring out your path, know that
  you are not alone. Life is full of twists and turns, but it’s the connections
  we make along the way that give it meaning.\r

  \r

  \r

  I’ve found that the secret to success in love and life isn’t about finding
  perfection—it’s about embracing imperfection, about showing up as you are, and
  about never losing sight of the joy and humor that make everything worth it.
  And if you ever need a little guidance on that journey, I’m here to help.
  After all, we’re all in this together.\r

  \r

  \r

  Here’s to love, to life, and to everything in between. May we all continue to
  grow, to love deeply, and to live fully. And may we never forget that we are
  deserving of all the good things life has to offer.\r

  \r

  \r

  With love and gratitude,\r

  \r

  \r
