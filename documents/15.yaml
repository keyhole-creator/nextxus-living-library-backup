  0:36
  things to remember when planning to grow
  0:38
  strawberries in your backyard
  0:40
  choosing plant strawberries come in many
  0:44
  varieties and are commonly known as June
  0:46
  bearing everbearing and day neutrals
  0:49
  June bearing varieties grow a single
  0:52
  crop annually with the largest berries
  0:54
  neutral varieties can be harvested up to
  0:57
  three times a year the fruit they
  0:59
  produce are smaller than June
  1:01
  strawberries everbearing and de neutrals
  1:03
  are perfect if you have a small yard as
  1:06
  they you'd lessor runners all these
  1:08
  different types of strawberry plants are
  1:10
  on the market so you can choose the ones
  1:12
  that suit your needs you should select a
  1:15
  place that gets full Sun to plant
  1:17
  strawberries as they grow in a sunny
  1:19
  area the field should have no perennial
  1:22
  weeds strawberries grow in an
  1:24
  environment with strong air circulation
  1:26
  and well-drained soil it is not
  1:28
  recommendable to grow strawberries in an
  1:30
  area where tomatoes eggplant or potatoes
  1:34
  have recently grown as your crop may
  1:35
  become contaminated with diverticulum
  1:38
  rot preparing soil preparing the soil is
  1:42
  important before planting strawberry
  1:45
  strawberries can grow in various soil
  1:47
  types but lomi and sandy soils work best
  1:50
  soil should be rich in organic matter
  1:53
  and well-drained the optimal range for
  1:56
  strawberries is 5.5 6.5 check the soil
  2:00
  in a laboratory before developing the
  2:02
  plans if not rich you can apply
  2:05
  fertilizers and manure to improve soil
  2:07
  quality
  2:08
  planting strawberry plants you can plant
  2:12
  strawberries once you've prepared the
  2:14
  soil they should be plan
  2:15
  in the spring season as soon as this oil
  2:18
  is ready sampling enough soil to fit
  2:20
  roots and grow strawberries ensure there
  2:23
  is enough spacing between plants to
  2:25
  produce runners if you plant them
  2:27
  closely then they couldn't grow properly
  2:30
  mulching strawberry plants are prone to
  2:33
  cold weather in the winter season the
  2:36
  soil should be covered with mulch to
  2:38
  avoid freezing mulching is important to
  2:41
  save plants from severe winter damage
  2:43
  you may use hay straw coarse wheat and
  2:46
  crushed cob for mulching care and
  2:49
  maintenance you can remove all flowers
  2:52
  from the plant during the first year
  2:54
  because it helps to reinforce roots inch
  2:56
  stem deflowering ensures plants are
  2:59
  strong and stable in the coming seasons
  3:01
  for better fruit growth watering plants
  3:04
  and adequate quantities is essential for
  3:06
  growing good quality fruit also
  3:08
  regularly check if there are any
  3:10
  unnecessary weeds that grow along with
  3:13
  the strawberry plants uproot the weeds
  3:15
  as they use soil nutrients necessary for
  3:18
  your plant growth harvesting the fruit
  3:22
  should be picked as soon as they are
  3:23
  ripe because if you allow them to stay
  3:25
  on the plants for a long time they will
  3:28
  be eaten by insects and birds over ripe
  3:31
  fruits attract rodents and insects to
  3:33
  avoid leaving overripe plant berries
  3:35
  soft succulent strawberries are
  3:38
  difficult to find story but they are
  3:40
  very easy to grow this member of the
  3:43
  rose family isn't really a fruit or a
  3:45
  berry above the enlarged receptacle of
  3:47
  the flower choose medium-sized berries
  3:50
  that are firm plump and deep red once
  3:53
  picked they don't ripen further first
  3:56
  cultivated in ancient Rome strawberries
  3:59
  are now the most popular berry fruit in
  4:01
  the world in provincial France they were
  4:04
  regarded as an aphrodisiac
  4:06
  these red jewels may be good for your
  4:08
  heart and more ways than one
  4:10
  strawberries are a high-value crop in
  4:13
  the United States the US is in fact the
  4:16
  world's largest producer of strawberries
  4:19
  accounting for nearly 1/3 of the world's
  4:21
  total production these potent little

  calorie food they are among the top 20
  4:47
  fruits and antioxidant capacity and are
  4:50
  a good source of manganese and potassium

  5:42
  who are sensitive to birch pollen or
  5:43
  apples may experience symptoms after
  5:45
  consuming strawberries strawberries are
  5:49
  low in calories delicious and healthy
  5:51
  they are a good source of many vitamins
  5:54
  minerals and plant compounds some of
  5:57
  which have powerful health benefits the
  6:00
  health benefits include reduced

  cholesterol blood pressure inflammation
  6:05
  and oxidative stress furthermore these
  6:09
  berries may help prevent big spikes in
  6:11
  both blood sugar and insulin levels
  6:13
  strawberries are an excellent addition
  6:15
  to a healthy diet check this for
  6:18
  establishing your strawberries choose a
  6:21
  good site eliminate all perennial weeds
  6:24
  prior to planting and annual weeds as
  6:27
  they appear choose a cultivar suitable
  6:30
  for your needs in sight choose a
  6:32
  planting system prepare the soil by
  6:36
  adding organic matter and lime if
  6:38
  necessary and by forming raised beds if
  6:41
  desired
  6:42
  apply fertilizer if necessary till the
  6:46
  soil purchase certified disease-free
  6:49
  plans plant in the spring setting plans
  6:52
  to the correct depth in the hill system
  6:56
  are plants in containers remove all
  6:58
  runners as they form in the matted row
  7:01
  train runners to the row 12 to 18 inches
  7:04
  wide
  7:05
  remove all runners that form after
  7:07
  September irrigate has required types of
  7:11
  strawberries June bearers June bearers
  7:15
  are among the most productive of
  7:17
  strawberries they have a main crop of
  7:19
  berries in June or July and produce lots
  7:22
  of runners from which new plants are
  7:23
  started within the strawberry bed June
  7:26
  bearers formed flower buds in the fall
  7:29
  in bare one heavy crop the next spring
  7:31
  or early summer after harvesting
  7:33
  renovate strawberry beds by mowing off
  7:36
  the leaves taking care not to damage the
  7:38
  Crown's renovation stimulates new plant
  7:41
  growth and reduces disease problems one
  7:45
  crop per year in June and July produce
  7:49
  many runners ever bearers ever bearers
  7:53
  and day neutrals have the same general
  7:55
  culture because day neutrals set fruit
  7:57
  all season long and total yields are
  7:59
  higher their cultivars are replacing
  8:02
  ever bearers in very cold areas
  8:05
  day-neutral cultivars offer an option as
  8:07
  they bloom over a long period of time
  8:09
  ever bearers bear fruit twice during the
  8:12
  growing season generally during the
  8:15
  spring ending late summer to crops per
  8:18
  year June to July and fall produce few
  8:22
  runners day neutrals day neutrals will
  8:26
  set fruit the year they are planted
  8:27
  because these cultivars set flower buds
  8:30
  regardless of day length they set fruit
  8:32
  from spring to fall they produce few
  8:35
  runners and can be planted either in
  8:37
  short rows or in Hills day neutrals are
  8:40
  sensitive to extreme heat so fruit
  8:42
  production generally drops during July
  8:44
  and August
  8:45
  they are often replaced after two
  8:47
  fruiting years as vigor and the fruit
  8:49
  size declines
  8:51
  drop almost continuously late May until
  8:54
  Frost produce few runners you can choose
  8:58
  from various cultivars varieties
  9:01
  available for each type of strawberry
  9:03
  capping or helling a strawberry fruit
  9:06
  means removing the green stem and leafy
  9:08
  part attached to the berry you can do
  9:10
  this by hand long fingernails help or
  9:13
  use a strawberry huller available in
  9:16
  most kitchens apply stores note some
  9:19
  cultivars are easier to cap than others
  9:21
  or the cap stays on the plant when you
  9:23
  pick the ripe fruit if you make a lot of
  9:26
  preserves or freeze a lot of berries you
  9:28
  may want to consider this when you
  9:30
  select a cultivar planting systems
  9:33
  choice in the matted row the runners
  9:36
  produced are allowed to fill in space 12
  9:38
  to 18 inches wide in the hill system you
  9:42
  must remove all runners that are
  9:44
  produced grow ever bearers and de
  9:47
  neutrals in a hill system as these types
  9:49
  produce few runners and won't form a
  9:51
  nice matted row you can grow June
  9:54
  bearers in either system matted row
  9:57
  versus Hill system the matted row
  10:00
  requires less labor to maintain and is
  10:02
  productive however if you let the row
  10:05
  get too dense diseases such as fruit
  10:07
  trot may become more of a problem and
  10:10
  fruit will be smaller the hill system
  10:13
  can produce both high yields and large
  10:15
  fruit provided you diligently remove all
  10:17
  runners that are produced before they
  10:19
  root the plants will branch and become
  10:22
  very productive planting strawberry
  10:25
  plants should be grown on raised beds to
  10:27
  avoid wet feet and root rot conditions
  10:29
  it also makes them much easier to pick
  10:32
  beds should be raised as high as
  10:34
  possible 1218 and formed too tall wide
  10:38
  on top with 40 between beds
  10:40
  center-to-center
  10:41
  after beds are raked smooth and pre
  10:44
  irrigated open a v-shaped hull about 6 7
  10:47
  deep with a trowel place a level
  10:49
  teaspoon of slow release fertilizer or
  10:51
  ammonium sulfate in the bottom of each
  10:53
  hole and cover with approximately 1 of
  10:56
  soil to prevent routeburn spread the
  10:58
  roots out in a fan shape in a fan shape
  11:00
  and the hole
  11:01
  cover with soil firming it around the
  11:04
  roots set plants at the exact level that
  11:07
  they were growing in the nursery not too
  11:09
  high nor too deep plans set too high
  11:12
  will be week and planned set too deep
  11:14
  will rot evenly spaced plants from made
  11:17
  15 apart in the bed depending upon the
  11:20
  ultimate size of that particular variety
  11:23
  strawberries grow well in a variety of
  11:25
  sandy or loam soils these soils provide
  11:28
  good drainage and warm up more readily
  11:30
  during the day which is especially
  11:32
  important during cooler parts of the
  11:34
  growing season when strawberry fields
  11:37
  are being prepared for planting the soil
  11:39
  is fumigated using an approved
  11:41
  broad-spectrum pesticide to kill soil
  11:44
  organisms that can harm the growing
  11:45
  plants or lead to decay of the fruit
  11:48
  raised beds are then created and covered
  11:50
  with plastic liners that limit plant and
  11:53
  bury contact with soil protecting the
  11:55
  plants and berries from contact with the
  11:57
  soil and standing water helps to prevent
  12:00
  decay best damage and contamination the
  12:04
  liners also trap heat from the Sun
  12:06
  allowing for the extension of the
  12:08
  growing season and they limit weed
  12:10
  growth there are various colors of
  12:12
  opaque liners that are used in different
  12:14
  regions and provide different degrees of
  12:16
  heat absorption watering is one of the
  12:19
  most essential parts of getting an
  12:21
  initial plant growth started no matter
  12:23
  what you might be planting and the
  12:25
  watering phases also what inspires new
  12:27
  plant growth from their berries are one
  12:30
  of the juiciest fruits out there and
  12:32
  this should already be an indication for
  12:34
  newer gardeners that they are going to
  12:36
  require a bit more water than some of
  12:38
  their counterparts but this doesn't mean
  12:41
  you should overwater them either
  12:43
  strawberry plants have shallow roots and
  12:46
  require consistent moisture throughout
  12:48
  the growing season newly planted plants
  12:50
  are generally overhead irrigated at
  12:52
  one-week intervals one inch of water to
  12:55
  get good initial vegetative growth and
  12:57
  then switched over to drip irrigation as
  12:59
  the season progresses overhead
  13:02
  irrigation can be used during the
  13:03
  growing season but should be monitored
  13:05
  carefully to minimize the time period
  13:07
  that the plants and fruits are actually
  13:09
  wet drip irrigation keeps the moisture
  13:12
  away from the fruit
  13:13
  prevents fruit dropped it is generally
  13:16
  run every day during the summer for 1/2
  13:18
  hours water source is used to irrigate
  13:21
  Strawberry Fields are many from
  13:23
  underground wells to surface water the
  13:26
  source type depends on the growing
  13:28
  region and resources available to the
  13:30
  farmer irrigation water is most often
  13:33
  delivered to the strawberry plant via
  13:35
  drip irrigation systems these systems
  13:37
  use rubber or plastic a tubing buried in
  13:40
  the raised beds to deliver water to the
  13:42
  roots where it is needed drip irrigation
  13:45
  also protects the fruit from contact
  13:47
  with irrigation water which could
  13:49
  transmit plant and human pathogens or
  13:51
  cause knowdo and premature softening
  13:54
  fast wildlife and rodent control on
  13:58
  strawberry farms are part of a good
  14:00
  strawberry safety program controlling
  14:02
  these pests helps protect the quality
  14:04
  and safety of the berries this is common
  14:07
  on many produced farms not just
  14:09
  strawberry farms during the growing
  14:12
  season in some regions temperatures can
  14:15
  drop below freezing when this happens it
  14:18
  is sometimes necessary to apply water to
  14:20
  the growing strawberry plant to protect
  14:22
  them from frost most home garden
  14:25
  strawberry plantings are mulched any
  14:27
  organic material free of weed seed makes
  14:30
  a good mulch hay straw and pine needles
  14:33
  are most frequently used mulch should be
  14:36
  applied 2 to 4 inches deep over and
  14:39
  around the plants after the first
  14:41
  freezing weather in the fall this
  14:43
  protects them from heaving and freezing
  14:45
  injury during the winter after the
  14:47
  danger of frost is over in the spring
  14:49
  about half the mulch should be raked off
  14:51
  the plants into the area between the
  14:53
  rouse mulch left around the plants will
  14:56
  help keep the berries clean conserve
  14:58
  moisture and check weed growth checklist
  15:01
  for taking care of your mature plants
  15:03
  protect the planting from frost if
  15:06
  possible avoid planting in frost pockets
  15:09
  or user row covers control weeds
  15:12
  irrigate as required in the hill system
  15:16
  remove all runners that form
  15:19
  in the matter drove system train runners
  15:21
  to the row 12 to 18 inches wide
  15:24
  remove all runners that form after
  15:26
  September June bearers pick fruit from
  15:30
  June to July renovate the planting after
  15:33
  harvest or remove it if it's no longer
  15:35
  productive fertilize in late summer
  15:39
  irrigate if necessary every bearers and
  15:42
  de neutrals pick fruit in June and July
  15:45
  and in the fall for day neutrals picked
  15:48
  throughout the season remove the
  15:51
  planting if it's no longer productive
  15:53
  fertilize make three or four
  15:56
  applications from spring through early
  15:58
  August irrigate if necessary insects
  16:02
  weevil several attack strawberries both
  16:05
  above and below ground most insecticides
  16:08
  are ineffective and so abandoning the
  16:10
  planting and moving to a pest free area
  16:13
  is recommended spider mites these tiny
  16:15
  insects produce webbing and stippling of
  16:18
  the foliage stunting the strawberry
  16:20
  plans and reducing yields and fruit
  16:22
  quality dusty conditions contribute to
  16:25
  spider mite populations overhead
  16:28
  watering especially when combined with
  16:30
  insecticidal soap is effective in
  16:32
  controlling most mites by washing them
  16:34
  off the plants and destroying their
  16:36
  habitat a foot skin damage foliage stunt
  16:40
  plants and cause damage to the fruit
  16:42
  during the early cool part of the season
  16:44
  generally insecticidal soap applied at
  16:48
  weekly intervals provides adequate
  16:49
  control leaf rolling caterpillars the
  16:53
  salt marsh caterpillar and cutworm will
  16:55
  feed on strawberry plants these can be
  16:58
  effectively controlled with bacillus
  17:00
  thuringiensis
  17:01
  BT Dipel reside etc slugs and snails
  17:06
  feed on foliage and fruit they can be
  17:09
  controlled with applications of metal to
  17:11
  hide with repeated applications
  17:13
  fertilizing before planting incorporate
  17:17
  two pounds of 5 10 5 or may 10th 2010
  17:20
  fertilizer or 3/4 pound 2100 ammonium
  17:24
  sulfate per 100 square feet into the
  17:26
  soil beginning before bloom in April
  17:29
  sigh and rest with a 1
  17:31
  pound of ammonium sulfate 2100 for 100
  17:35
  square feet per month until mid-august
  17:37
  at key WABCO he use our own compost and
  17:41
  very lightly use any chemicals
  17:43
  commercial growers almost exclusively
  17:45
  use chemical fertilizers the use of
  17:48
  compost is rare fertilizers can be added
  17:51
  by injection into the soil through the
  17:54
  irrigation system by injecting into the
  17:56
  water also known as cavitation or added
  17:59
  as a side dressing in the furrow which
  18:01
  is then distributed when it rains
  18:03
  there's a lot to be gained from the
  18:05
  plants harvest including a long list of
  18:08
  health benefits owing to the fact that
  18:10
  they're much higher in vitamins and
  18:12
  minerals compared to fruits that are
  18:13
  twice their size what could be better
  18:16
  than picking strawberries out of your
  18:18
  very own garden any gardener knows that
  18:21
  few things are as satisfying as
  18:22
  literally picking the fruit harvesting
  18:25
  in the garden strawberries should be
  18:27
  allowed to attain an overall red color
  18:29
  and become fully ripe before harvesting
  18:32
  it is at this stage that the sugar
  18:34
  content is highest and the flavor is
  18:36
  best it is necessary to harvest every
  18:39
  day or every other day during the peak
  18:41
  of the season harvest the berries
  18:43
  carefully by the stems to prevent
  18:45
  bruising pick all that is ripe since
  18:48
  they will not keep until the next
  18:50
  harvest ripe strawberries may be held
  18:53
  for a day or two in a refrigerator here
