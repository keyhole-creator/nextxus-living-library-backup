  It can be just as difficult to absorb success as to accept failure.\r

  Posted December 18, 2018 | \r

  It can be just as difficult to absorb success as to accept failure. Some
  people never feel that they are good enough. Here are 10 tips to help you take
  in and create the ability to be proud of yourself.\r

  1. Believe that you deserve your success. Many people who have achieved a
  dream feel that they don’t deserve it. This can come from a lot of places, and
  in psychology, it is sometimes known as the impostor syndrome.\r

  2. Don’t undervalue yourself. Where you are could not and would not have
  happened if not for you. Truthfully, if don’t give yourself enough credit, it
  can undermine your self-esteem, and that will affect the success you are
  trying to build upon.\r

  3. Celebrate your successes. Most of the time, ambitious people just move on
  to the next thing without so much as a sushi dinner. You have to celebrate
  successes, because the celebration helps embed the success chip into your
  brain. And besides, you deserve it.\r

  4. Forget yesterday. We have all had failures, and those who claim otherwise
  are lying. You can’t be successful without a few missteps along the way. Own
  up to past failures, and then let them go.\r

  5. Don’t count on tomorrow. Be happy with what you have created, but don’t get
  caught up in thinking that there will always be an elevator to the top. All
  successful people have ups and downs, and most of the time that isn’t easy,
  but being content with where you are right now is a pretty simple attitude
  adjustment.\r

  6. Forgive yourself for not being Bill Gates. Do you really want to be the
  richest person in the world, or is your life really nice, and you’d just like
  it to be a little nicer? What Bill did was decide to give away his billions to
  those in need, because he doesn’t need all that money to have a nice life.
  Neither do you.\r

  7. Reward those who have helped you. If you are fortunate enough to have good
  people supporting you in your endeavors, then it is very important that they
  feel valued. Money is nice, but people also want a pat on the back and to be
  acknowledged by their peers. See what you can do about helping them feel great
  about themselves and about what they are doing for and with you.\r

  8. Understand that success can change how people relate to you. Most people
  who have become successful notice they are treated differently after acquiring
  fame and fortune, and it’s not always better. Some people may be envious of
  what you’ve created. Being aware and getting objective advice will help you
  avoid those who would take advantage of you or try to take away what you
  have.\r

  9. Accept awards and nominate yourself. Awards help you believe that you
  deserve your success. My staff nominated me for my first award, and I won. I
  usually don’t think of myself in that way, but having someone honor my
  commitment to humanity is still deeply moving.\r

  10. Share your success with those you love. I would not be where I am if not
  for the love of a good woman, my friends and family who support me, and the
  millions of people who read my words. I do my best to thank everyone in my
  circle. We all feel better for it.\r

  Success is attainable for most all of us. Hard work, lucky breaks, and good
  ideas all help to get you there, and learning how to live with it, so you can
  continue to share your gifts with the world, is what it’s all about.\r

  Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of fine-tuning your website to
  increase its chances of ranking well on the search engine results pages
  (SERPs) of relevant keywords. When customers search for your products, you
  want your website to rank on the first SERP among the top 10 results. Earning
  these prized positions is a key ingredient for generating consistent, relevant
  website traffic.\r

  \r

  \r

  SEO is a fine science that requires learning the rules that govern search
  engines like Google and applying them selectively to your site. SEO tools such
  as Ahrefs and SemRush can help you find opportunities to optimize your content
  and improve its performance. \r

  \r

  \r

  In this section, we’ll discuss ecommerce SEO best practices that will help you
  optimize your site.\r

  \r

  \r

  1. Write title tags that match search intent\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  Title tags are the text that appears on SERPs, influencing whether a user
  clicks through to your website. Along with the meta description (more below),
  this is the first impression your site gives to potential visitors discovering
  you via search engines. \r

  \r

  \r

  It’s important to follow these guidelines when writing website title tags:\r

  \r

  \r

  Create unique titles for each webpage\r

  Keep titles less than 55 characters\r

  Be consistent with your use of title or sentence case across page titles\r

  Include a target keyword\r

  Ensure titles match the search intent of queries\r

  “Titles are critical to giving users a quick insight into the content of a
  result and why it’s relevant to their query,” Google explains. “It’s often the
  primary piece of information used to decide which result to click on, so it’s
  important to use high-quality titles on your web pages.”\r

  \r

  2. Write irresistible meta descriptions\r

  Traffic: 👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  The text that appears underneath a website’s title tag on a SERP is known as a
  meta description. Whereas title tags grab attention and tell searchers what to
  expect if they click through to the website, a meta description acts as a
  summary of the linked page’s content. \r

  \r

  \r

  Clicks to pages can be won by an alluring and interesting meta description.
  “They are like a pitch that convinces the user that the page is exactly what
  they’re looking for,” according to Google.\r

  \r

  \r

  If your meta description doesn’t offer a compelling reason to click, it could
  affect your organic search ranking. It’s also worth noting that meta
  descriptions can be any length, but they’re often truncated to fit the device
  the search is performed on.\r

  \r

  \r

  To write a high-quality meta description:\r

  \r

  \r

  Summarize the linked page’s content\r

  Cap its length at fewer than 145 characters\r

  Make the description unique for each page\r

  Use sentence case\r

  Include intriguing, click-worthy information\r

  Include a page’s target keyword\r

  3. Prioritize backlink building\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  One of the primary ranking factors in Google’s algorithms is
  authoritativeness. Essentially, Google is saying that a website should have a
  good reputation and produce credible content in order for it to rank higher on
  SERPs. So how do you demonstrate to Google that your website is authoritative?
  \r

  \r

  \r

  A backlinks strategy is one way to do it. That involves earning links to your
  website from other reputable websites. Earning backlinks to your content from
  high-quality and relevant sites signals to Google that your domain publishes
  reputable and reliable content and therefore should be prioritized in
  rankings. The more backlinks you receive from trusted entities, the more
  authoritative search engines will deem your site. It’s also a valuable
  strategy for combining SEO and CRO (conversion rate optimization).\r

  \r

  \r

  Here are some ideas for building backlinks to help you improve your sites
  authoritativeness and generate traffic:\r

  \r

  \r

  Guest post on other blogs: Share insights with new audiences and link back to
  your website where relevant.\r

  Curate expert roundups: Gather tips from industry experts, notify them once
  you publish the roundups on your website’s blog, then encourage those experts
  to share your posts with their networks.\r

  Solicit product reviews: Offer free products to bloggers with relevant,
  engaged audiences in exchange for honest reviews that link back to your
  site.\r

  Start an affiliate program: Incentivize other people to drive traffic to your
  website by using an affiliate program and offering a commission on every
  sale.\r

  Get press coverage: If you have a great story or an interesting product that
  people will want to write about, put it out there! Get in touch with
  journalists who cover businesses like yours and tell them what you’re up to.\r

  \r

  4. Add internal links to and from important pages\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  Similarly to building backlinks, another important SEO strategy is internal
  linking—the practice of linking individual pages of your site to one another.
  This creates a structure for your site, improving both user navigation and the
  way Google understands the relationships between your pages.\r

  \r

  \r

  Internal linking also distributes something called PageRank, which is Google’s
  way of measuring the importance of a webpage. Pages with more links pointing
  to them—like backlinks from high-authority sites—tend to have a higher
  PageRank. \r

  \r

  \r

  When you link from a high PageRank page on your site to another page, you pass
  along some of that authority. This helps the linked page rank better in search
  results because of its association to the page that’s already highly ranked.
  By linking from less important pages back to key pages, you can reinforce
  their importance to Google.\r

  \r

  \r

  Here’s what you can do to optimize your website’s internal linking:\r

  \r

  \r

  Optimize your site structure.\r

  Find and submit your sitemap to Google Search Console.\r

  Add breadcrumbs to your product categories to instantly create internal
  links.\r

  Make a list of high-value target pages you’d like to rank better.\r

  Identify the pages on your website that currently have the most authority and
  page rank.\r

  Add a link from your authority pages to your target pages. \r

  Incorporate links naturally, using anchor text related to the keyword you’d
  like the target page to rank for.\r

  5. Add long-tail keyword variations to your pages\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  Next on the SEO checklist for your website is building a keyword strategy.
  Because they’re easier to identify, it’s tempting to target short, high-volume
  search terms. But your domain as a whole needs to be really strong in order to
  qualify for those keywords. Until then, you’ll have much better luck targeting
  lower-volume (and therefore lower competition) keywords. \r

  \r

  \r

  Long-tail keywords, which are more detailed or specific search queries, are
  easier to rank for and usually have a much higher click-through rate than
  shorter, more generic terms. That’s because long-tail keywords often match
  more niche intent-driven searches. In other words, people searching those
  keywords know exactly what they’re looking for—and if you can match their
  search intent, it’ll make a positive impact on your site traffic.\r

  \r

  \r

  Imagine you run an online store selling running shoes and want to optimize a
  page to attract more website traffic. Instead of just targeting the broad
  keyword “running shoes,” which has a lot of competition, you can focus on
  long-tail keywords—more specific phrases that people are searching for.\r

  \r

  \r

  For example, your keyword research might show that people are searching for
  things like “best running shoes for flat feet” or “running shoes for marathon
  training.” To optimize your product page, you could incorporate those phrases
  in your product descriptions. To make the page even more competitive, you
  could create a blog post or landing page that helps people choose from your
  selection of running shoes based on their specific needs.\r

  \r

  \r

  6. Stand out with rich snippets\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  Rich snippets are search results that have been enhanced with extra
  information, such as ratings, pricing, images, and availability. These details
  can help your links stand out and attract more clicks.\r

  \r

  \r

  To create these rich snippets, your website needs to use structured data. You
  can think of structured data as some extra coding that helps Google identify
  specific aspects of your page—like that a particular piece of text is a
  product price or that a star rating refers to customer reviews.\r

  \r

  \r

  To check and manage your structured data, utilize tools such as the Google
  Structured Data Testing Tool, which helps identify and fix any issues with
  your site’s markup.\r

  \r

  \r

  7. Focus on local SEO\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  An important aspect of building a traffic generation plan is to ensure that
  you’re driving the right kind of traffic to your website. If you’re a
  brick-and-mortar business, it’s going to be pretty important that any traffic
  coming your way is coming from a specific geographic area: locally. \r

  \r

  \r

  Local SEO helps you accomplish two things at once: focus on the right audience
  and rank more easily on SERPs. For example, you’re going to have a much easier
  time ranking for “ballet shoe store in Lincolnville, Maine” than for the more
  general “ballet shoes.”\r

  \r

  \r

  Here are a few things to keep in mind when building your local SEO strategy:\r

  \r

  \r

  Create a Google Business profile: Formerly called Google My Business, Google
  Business is a free tool that quite literally puts your business on the map.
  That means customers can find it when searching on Google Maps, but it also
  means that Google knows to tie your listing to localized keywords (like
  “ballet shoes near me”).\r

  Keep your name, address, phone number (NAP) consistent: Google looks for
  consistent NAP details across your website, Google Business profile, and
  online directories to verify your business’s legitimacy. Inconsistent
  information can confuse search engines and harm your local rankings, as Google
  may struggle to determine if the listings belong to the same business.\r

  Tailor your keyword strategy to your locale: Use keywords that include your
  city, neighborhood, or region to attract nearby customers and boost your
  chances of ranking higher for local searches.\r

  Content marketing\r

  Using focused content and promotion can help drive targeted traffic to your
  online store, making it more likely that visitors convert. From videos and
  podcasts to guides and ebooks, there are endless opportunities for your
  business to branch out into the world of content to generate traffic. \r

  \r

  \r

  Content marketing is the process of creating interesting, informative, and
  engaging content to organically attract traffic to your website. With original
  content, you can connect with your audience, build trust, and grow your
  brand’s authority. The more useful and relevant your content is, the more
  traffic you’ll attract over time.\r

  \r

  \r

  Your content marketing strategy shouldn’t just talk about your products—that
  would get boring for you and your target audience real quick. Instead, think
  about the topics or resources related to your business that your customers
  would find useful. It’s especially wise to focus on topics for which you’re a
  subject matter expert (SME) because that will help your credibility with
  readers—and Google. \r

  \r

  \r

  Next, we’ll talk about a few ideas to help you come up with a hard-hitting
  content marketing strategy that’ll have you raking in the clicks in no time.\r

  8. Write a blog\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Months\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  When it comes to content marketing, you can’t go wrong with a blog. It’s one
  of the best ways to build internal links, attract backlinks, and establish
  your business as credible in the eyes of both potential customers and search
  engines.\r

  \r

  \r

  While there is ample opportunity to reach an audience with blogging, you’ll
  need to be purposeful about your content to attract relevant traffic. For most
  blogs, the best editorial policy is to create content optimized for search
  that answers questions and solves problems that are important to your target
  audience. Finding the right topics to write about involves persona building,
  keyword research, and content gap analysis.\r

  \r

  \r

  To decide what to write about, consider what your target audience would
  benefit from reading and why your business is the right source for that
  information. Featuring experts and influencers could be a good way to get
  traffic right out the gate, as they may be willing to share the article with
  their followers, which would broaden your blog’s reach.\r

  9. Produce podcasts\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Months\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  Podcasting, like blogging, allows you to tap into a specific niche and reach a
  target audience. What makes podcasts effective for driving traffic is their
  ability to build trust and connection with listeners over time. A loyal
  podcast audience is more likely to follow your recommendations and visit your
  website to learn more information or explore products.\r

  \r

  \r

  Unlike a blog or social media post, however, there’s no call to action that
  easily turns a podcast listener into a website visitor. As a result, you’ll
  need to find ways for listeners to easily reach your website. Shuang Esther
  Shan, who manages the Shopify Masters podcast, uses three methods to nudge
  listeners to the brand’s website. \r

  \r

  \r

  Here are Shuang’s tips for driving website traffic via your podcast: \r

  \r

  \r

  Publish episode transcripts and summaries as blog posts to make them more
  accessible for deaf or hard of hearing audiences. \r

  Write an episode summary in the show notes that includes a link to the
  episode’s corresponding blog post.\r

  Compile lists of useful resources mentioned in each episode—prioritizing any
  products or tools that you provide on your website—and link to them in the
  show notes\r

  10. Make videos\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Months\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  As the second-largest search engine in the world, YouTube gives you access to
  a massive audience actively searching for solutions, entertainment, and
  information. It has more than 2.7 billion active users and a wider reach among
  18- to 49-year-olds than all US cable TV networks combined.\r

  \r

  \r

  By starting a YouTube channel, you can engage viewers through visual
  storytelling. Videos hold attention longer than other types of content, making
  it easier to convey your message and build a connection with your audience. \r

  \r

  \r

  To make YouTube marketing work for your business, it’s important to focus on
  content that aligns with your brand and audience. Here are three types of
  YouTube videos you can create to attract the right viewers and drive traffic
  to your website:\r

  \r

  \r

  Educational content: Teach new skills to build trust with your audience and,
  if possible, use your product as the centerpiece for solving their problem.
  Educational webinars are an especially great way to highlight product features
  and the pain points it solves.\r

  Storytelling: Communicate your brand’s image and values to a wider audience
  with inspiring narrative videos that fit your business’s identity and your
  audience’s lifestyle.\r

  Entertainment: Capture viewers’ attention and focus it on your products with
  fun videos that cater to your audience’s interests and use humor relevant to
  your niche.\r

  11. Invest in email marketing\r

  Traffic: 👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Months\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  Whether it’s promotional campaigns or recurring newsletters, email marketing
  is a dependable way to drive traffic to your website and build a loyal
  audience. With the right strategy, emails can do more than generate visits;
  they nurture long-term relationships with customers by offering value and
  keeping them engaged.\r

  \r

  \r

  Even better, email marketing is highly cost-effective. With an average ROI of
  $36 for every $1 spent, it can deliver massive returns for minimal investment.
  And the best part? It doesn’t have to be complicated. Focus on sending
  personalized, timely messages—such as product updates, special offers, or
  helpful educational content—to stay top of mind and encourage recipients to
  return to your website.\r

  \r

  \r

  Organic social media engagement\r

  Generating traffic via social media requires much more than just posting ads
  for your website. Whether or not you use paid advertising on social media
  (more on that later), it’s crucial that you organically build an engaged
  following on the social networks that make the most sense for your brand. \r

  \r

  \r

  You can drive social engagement by doing things like: \r

  \r

  \r

  Encouraging conversations with your target audience\r

  Responding thoughtfully to inquiries and discussions related to your brand,
  products, or industry\r

  Driving enthusiasm and investment through community-building tactics\r

  Below, we’ll cover a few examples of how to cultivate an organic social media
  presence.\r

  \r

  \r

  12. Get friends and family to share\r

  Traffic: 👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  When you launch your business, turning to friends and family for support is a
  great tactic to generate initial awareness, traffic, or even your first sale
  (thanks, Mom!).\r

  \r

  \r

  Take inspiration from the content website Upworthy. It generated its initial
  traffic by reaching out to friends and family. The company set a goal of
  getting 1,000 Facebook fans by the end of launch day—and it worked, providing
  valuable traction.\r

  \r

  \r

  Reach out to your friends and family in a targeted way. Are there channels for
  talking to your extended family, coworkers, or community? Send a note and tell
  them about your new store. On social media, tell the story of your business in
  an update.\r

  \r

  \r

  Once you have the attention of your friends and family, ask them to share your
  website with their networks. This type of exponential reach is the key to
  successful word-of-mouth marketing.\r

  \r

  \r

  13. Proactively engage on Instagram\r

  Traffic: 👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Leverage: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  You don’t need to start selling products or publishing content before you
  engage with people on Instagram. It can actually help to build up an engaged
  following before you start selling, so you already have an audience interested
  in your brand at launch time. Toronto bakery Blackbird Baking Company built an
  audience of engaged, passionate bread lovers on Instagram before it opened its
  first storefront. This ensured it had a great reception when it opened its
  doors.\r

  \r

  \r

  Blackbird Baking Company took these initial steps in their social media
  marketing strategy in order to build their audience:\r

  \r

  \r

  The bakery generated follow-backs by following select people it determined may
  be interested in a new bakery. These included restaurateurs and self-declared
  bread enthusiasts in Toronto. You can find people with interests in your niche
  or field by searching relevant keywords in bios and profiles on the social
  platforms where you’re building your online presence.\r

  Blackbird posted photos of its bread at all stages of the process, giving a
  behind-the-scenes look at its business with a focus on its core product. It
  made sure its photos of bread being baked and delivered to stores were
  mouthwatering and shareable.\r

  It engaged proactively with followers to discuss local community issues.
  Topics included life in Toronto, great food, and—of course—bread. \r

  Thanks to those Instagram marketing tactics, when the bakery finally opened,
  there were lots of interested people waiting to buy its goods.\r

  \r

  \r

  Here’s how you can engage with your brand’s Instagram audience:\r

  \r

  \r

  Once you’ve started building an audience, look for chances to help people or
  add value to their conversations in a way that connects on a human level and
  lacks a sales pitch.\r

  Use Instagram Reels to promote specials that are only available to your
  audience if they contact you on the platform.\r

  Spend time engaging with those talking about your brand. Instagram is a great
  place to answer questions and proactively engage with your community.\r

  14. Engage on Reddit\r

  Traffic: 👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  Reddit poses an interesting opportunity to grow brand awareness and generate
  website traffic. It’s a place where passionate folks congregate around their
  favorite topics, sharing advice, best practices, and personal life stories.
  Reddit has thousands of niche-based forums, called subreddits. You can find a
  subreddit on nearly any subject, for example, /r/bicycling, /r/scifi, or
  /r/corgi.\r

  \r

  \r

  Here’s how you could use Reddit if your business is selling hair products.
  Navigate to a few subreddits such as /r/femalehairadvice, where there’s
  discussion on all aspects of hair care for women. There are also subreddits
  like /r/haircarescience, /r/curlyhair, or simply /r/hair.\r

  \r

  \r

  To promote your business and drive traffic to your website, create a new post
  in a subreddit relevant to your brand. Make the post brief but detailed, with
  concrete examples to engage readers. \r

  \r

  \r

  Here are the components of a great Reddit post:\r

  \r

  \r

  Catchy headline: Keep it topical to the subreddit. For example, when posting
  to the curly hair subreddit, you could try the headline, “Who says that short
  hair can’t be fancy?”\r

  Add value and be concise: The text within the main body of the post should be
  snappy, catchy, but not salesy. Also, consider a TL;DR (“too long, didn’t
  read”) subheading that gives visitors a quick summary of the gist of your
  post.\r

  Include a photo: Adding images can help convey your message and more easily
  captivate readers.\r

  Link to your store: Make sure you link to your most relevant product, so
  visitors can find out more about your brand and product line by visiting your
  online store.\r

  Pay attention to Reddit’s platform guidelines and Reddiquette values. Some
  subreddits don’t allow promotional material. If you post about your site in a
  thread that doesn’t want it, you may find that no one upvotes your link, and
  you may get banned from the subreddit.\r

  \r

  \r

  Alongside promoting your website on relevant subreddits, you can also turn to
  threads like /r/entrepreneur or /r/smallbusiness to get business advice,
  tapping the know-how of millions of subscribers at varying levels of
  experience across industries.\r

  Contests and giveaways are a great way to get more followers on Instagram,
  increase social media engagement, and drive traffic to your website. With
  viral contests, giveaways, and sweepstakes, you can quickly drive traffic to
  your website by exchanging contest entries for sharing your site or following
  your social accounts.\r

  \r

  \r

  Contest and giveaway apps in the Shopify App Store make it simple to embed
  giveaways into landing pages and blog posts. Social sharing gives sweepstakes
  a chance to go viral and extend your reach. \r

  16. Offer time-sensitive discounts\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  Offering time-sensitive discounts can be an effective way to get people to
  take action, generating traffic and increasing sales. Putting an expiration on
  your discount leverages scarcity, a powerful psychological sales trigger.\r

  \r

  \r

  Consider adding a minimum qualifying purchase for your discount offer. This
  can be a smart way to offer your audience an incentive without compromising
  your profitability.\r

  \r

  \r

  Product discounts aren’t the only time-sensitive offer you can provide
  customers. If you don’t normally offer free shipping, then occasionally doing
  so can be a compelling incentive to direct traffic from social media or email
  marketing campaigns to your store.\r

  \r

  \r

  17. Leverage user-generated content\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  Let’s face it: Coming up with fresh content regularly can take up quite a bit
  of time. That’s where user-generated content (UGC) comes in. Sharing content
  from customers who have enjoyed your products or services is a quick way to
  drive traffic to your website. UGC promotes your brand through authentic
  voices, which increases brand engagement and reach.\r

  \r

  \r

  It’s also a shortcut to building trust with new leads because, as we know,
  people tend to trust the words of fellow consumers more than the brand itself.
  Best of all, reposting UGC encourages more people to share their experiences
  and tag your business in the future, generating even more organic
  visibility.\r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  Influencer marketing involves partnering with successful social media content
  creators to promote your website to relevant users. This form of marketing
  harnesses the creativity and reach of notable people in your industry,
  leveraging the trust they’ve earned with audiences to refer traffic to your
  store.\r

  \r

  \r

  As many as 70% of shoppers use Instagram to inform purchasing decisions,
  highlighting its potential to convert browsing into sales. This makes
  Instagram an excellent avenue for boosting brand visibility and driving
  traffic to your online store—especially when you partner with an influencer
  who knows how to hack the algorithm.\r

  \r

  \r

  Bloggers and social media celebrities are highly trusted by their followers.
  Finding a relevant influencer to feature your products is often an effective
  tactic for increasing your traffic. For example, lifestyle influencer Estée
  Lalonde promotes brands by incorporating products into her lifestyle
  content.\r

  Paid social media advertising\r

  To increase website traffic, you need to be able to get your business in front
  of your ideal customers. With paid social media ads, you can create highly
  targeted campaigns that serve tailor-made ads to customers who are most likely
  to purchase your products.\r

  \r

  \r

  If you’re interested in running paid social media ads and you have the
  marketing budget, consider the following platforms.\r

  \r

  \r

  19. Facebook ads\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  With more than three billion monthly active users, Facebook is the largest
  social media platform in the world. Facebook ads allow you to target users by
  their interests, behaviors, locations, and more, all of which optimizes your
  chances of conversion.\r

  \r

  \r

  Use Facebook dynamic ads to target potential customers based on their browsing
  history and online activity. The content of these ads is automatically
  generated, showing relevant products from your website that people are likely
  to be interested in.\r

  \r

  \r

  For even more precise targeting, add the Meta pixel to your website.
  Advertising pixels track user behavior to refine ad content and placement. \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  20. Instagram ads\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  More than 62% of Instagram’s two-billion users follow or research brand
  accounts. That means having your own business account could be a valuable
  source of engaged traffic. But if you’re only aiming for organic Instagram
  engagement, you might be missing its full potential. Incorporating Instagram
  ads into your content mix can boost your website traffic and increase sales.
  Plus, you can sell directly on Instagram, so users don’t need to leave the
  platform to become customers.\r

  \r

  \r

  If you’re using a personal account, converting it to a business account will
  unlock additional features that are essential for advertisers. You can create
  ads in various formats such as photos, videos, carousels, collections, and
  stories, allowing for flexible and creative marketing approaches.\r

  \r

  \r

  Exploring Instagram’s tools and hashtags, and jumping on the platform’s latest
  trends can win you more followers and strengthen your campaigns.\r

  \r

  \r

  21. Pinterest ads\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  If you’re looking for ways to attract buyers to your online store, Pinterest
  is a source of motivated traffic with clearly signaled interests. According to
  Pinterest, compared to other social media sites, users tend to be more
  affluent and more willing to spend.\r

  \r

  \r

  Promoted Pins are especially useful for reaching people who are actively
  looking for ideas and products. This type of Pinterest ad displays your
  content at the top of search results, and it’s been shown to influence users’
  purchasing decisions.\r

  \r

  \r

  Pinterest works best when targeting niche audiences. Whether someone is
  redoing their garden, planning a wedding, or updating their home décor, the
  platform helps associate your brand with their interests.\r

  \r

  \r

  22. Google Ads\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  Google Ads stands out from social media advertising by targeting people who
  are already searching for the type of products or content your website
  provides. These ads let you place your web pages in front of users who’ve made
  relevant searches on Google and YouTube.\r

  \r

  \r

  There are several Google ad formats, including:\r

  \r

  \r

  Search ads that appear on search engine results pages\r

  Display ads that may appear anywhere in the Google Display Network\r

  Shopping ads that highlight media and products in search results\r

  Video ads to capture the attention of YouTube viewers\r

  Understanding these tools and effectively applying them can maximize your ad
  spend. Creating and managing these types of ads is a discipline that takes
  time to learn, but when deployed effectively, it can flood your website with
  relevant traffic.\r

  \r

  \r

  23. TikTok ads\r

  Traffic: 👤👤👤👤\r

  Cost: 💰💰\r

  Time to ROI: Days\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  Despite questions over its long-term future in the US, TikTok continues to be
  a powerful platform for sourcing traffic. Users increasingly view TikTok as a
  place to find new content that matches their interests. For marketers, it’s a
  space to connect with large audiences in almost any demographic.\r

  \r

  \r

  While creating TikTok marketing content takes time, it can be a great platform
  to add to your marketing toolkit. You can also use TikTok Shop to sell on the
  platform, so you don’t always need to convince users to visit your site.\r

  \r

  \r

  The TikTok ads platform is easy to use, with preset options for budgeting and
  audience selection.\r

  \r

  \r

  Reach customers everywhere they are with Shopify\r

  \r

  \r

  Shopify comes with powerful tools that help you promote and sell products on
  Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google, and YouTube from one back office. Make
  sales on multiple channels and manage everything from Shopify.\r

  \r

  \r

  Explore Shopify’s sales channels\r

  In-person traffic\r

  If your brand has a physical presence—through events, brick-and-mortar
  storefronts, or product packaging—you can turn interactions in real life (IRL)
  into website traffic. Bridging the gap between offline and online channels
  helps you engage customers wherever they’re already interacting with your
  business. \r

  \r

  24. Encourage in-person customers to connect online\r

  Time to ROI: Weeks\r

  Effort: Medium\r

  \r

  \r

  If you have a physical store or pop-up location, use it to build your online
  audience. Existing customers are more likely to engage with your website if
  you give them a reason to do so. Incentivize them to explore your online store
  by offering perks such as exclusive discounts, loyalty points, or early access
  to new products.\r

  \r

  \r

  Make sure to advertise your website prominently throughout your physical
  space. Use signage, receipts, and product packaging to direct customers to
  specific landing pages or promotions. You can also collect email addresses at
  checkout by encouraging customers to sign up for your newsletter in exchange
  for an incentive. For example, they could get a discount code to redeem at
  your online store. The key is to make the connection between your physical and
  digital presence seamless and valuable.\r

  \r

  25. Create a QR code \r

  Effort: Low\r

  \r

  \r

  After 2020, everyone and their mother learned how to use QR codes—and started
  to really appreciate their convenience. QR codes make it super simple for
  potential customers to visit your website if offline advertising piques their
  interest. To scan your QR code, a customer simply opens their phone camera,
  points it at the code, and taps the link that pops up at the bottom of their
  screen. \r

  \r

  \r

  You can embed QR codes into product packaging, event flyers, or in-store
  displays to direct customers to your site, product pages, or exclusive offers.

  Effort: High\r

  \r

  \r

  Find ways to team up with fellow local businesses at community events, trade
  shows, pop-ups, and other types of brand activations. This is a smart way to
  generate buzz and attract new customers locally. Offering free samples,
  handouts, or product trials helps spark interest by letting people experience
  your brand firsthand. \r

  \r

  \r

  When you participate in events like these, make sure it’s clear how attendees
  can engage with you later online. For example, you could hand out flyers,
  promote event-exclusive offers they can claim on your website, or encourage
  them to follow your brand on social media. \r

  \r

  \r

  How to choose a marketing strategy\r

  Having so many options for marketing means you can find one that’s perfect for
  your business—but it can also feel pretty overwhelming. \r

  \r

  \r

  To pick the marketing strategy that’s right for your needs, start by asking
  yourself: \r

  \r

  \r

  What are your marketing goals?\r

  How much time do you have to dedicate to marketing efforts? \r

  What’s your marketing budget, and can you afford hiring anyone to help?\r

  Next up, we’ll walk you through answers to those key questions to help you
  choose the best marketing strategies for your business.\r

  \r

  \r

  1. Set your goals\r

  Your business stage will inform your goals. If you’re just starting your
  business, you need to build brand awareness fast with a big surge of traffic
  that will get your business off the ground. Building a social following and
  testing paid ads could help. \r

  \r

  \r

  On the other hand, if you’ve been running your business for a few years but
  haven’t seen the kind of growth you had hoped for, it may be time to try
  strategies that take longer to pay off but lead to more consistent traffic
  generation over time. In that case, SEO marketing practices could be a
  long-term boon. \r

  \r

  \r

  Outside of your business’s age, consider your immediate and long-term
  priorities: Do you want quick conversions for a new product launch, or are you
  looking to create a steady flow of visitors who will return over time? Some of
  the marketing strategies in the list above generate highly relevant traffic
  for your website, while others produce large volumes of general visitors. Your
  goals should guide your choice of tactics, so think about how soon you need to
  see a return on investment (ROI), and select the best strategies that fit your
  timeline.\r

  \r

  \r

  2. Consider your audience\r

  It’s crucial to understand who your target audience is and which marketing
  tactics will resonate most with them. For example, going viral on TikTok can
  direct loads of traffic to your website, but if they aren’t buying what you’re
  selling, that traffic isn’t going to be of much use to you. On the other hand,
  a well-positioned LinkedIn post or a targeted Google Ad doesn’t have to make a
  lot of noise to both drive traffic and convert.\r

  \r

  \r

  To narrow down the best marketing strategies for your audience, ask
  yourself:\r

  \r

  \r

  Where does my audience spend the majority of their time online? Social media
  platforms, search engines, or forums?\r

  What kind of content do they respond to? Informative blog posts, engaging
  videos, or short social media updates?\r

  What problem are they trying to solve, and how can my product help? Align your
  marketing efforts with their needs and interests.\r

  For example, if your audience is primarily young professionals, you might
  focus on LinkedIn ads or email campaigns. For a younger demographic, Instagram
  Reels or TikTok could be more effective. Tailoring your marketing to your
  audience’s preferences ensures that your efforts generate meaningful traffic
  that leads to sales or engagement.\r

  \r

  \r

  3. Take a look at your budget\r

  According to The CMO Survey from spring 2024, businesses that make less than
  $10 million in annual revenue typically spend around 16% of their budgets on
  marketing. That’s not a hard-and-fast rule—if your business is new or
  struggling, you might not be able to allocate quite that much to a marketing
  budget. \r

  \r

  \r

  In general, though, you’ll have to look at the books before you can make a
  decision about which marketing strategy is right for your business:\r

  \r

  \r

  High-budget strategies like paid advertising often deliver fast results but
  come with higher costs and don’t compound value over time.\r

  Lower-budget strategies like content marketing and organic social media take
  more time but can be cheaper and more sustainable with long-term compounded
  value.\r

  4. Use your existing skills (or be ready to hire someone)\r

  Whereas some of the strategies on this list can be pulled off without much of
  a marketing background, others require time, skill, and experience to execute.
  When you’re running a business, you can’t dedicate the time necessary to
  developing a new craft. For instance, if you aren’t already social media
  savvy, it’s unlikely you’ll get the hang of it quickly enough that you’ll be
  raking in the views without a significant time investment. \r

  \r

  \r

  Some strategies, like blogging or email marketing, can often be handled by
  business owners, even with little-to-no marketing experience. These tactics
  are straightforward, affordable, and can be learned through practice. For
  example, creating email campaigns or writing blog posts can be done in-house
  with tools like Shopify Email and a simple content calendar.\r

  \r

  \r

  However, other strategies require more specialized skills. Running PPC ads,
  managing SEO campaigns, or producing high-quality video content can take
  months to learn and execute effectively. \r

  \r

  \r

  Be honest about what you can handle and where you need help. If you’re
  stretched too thin, consider hiring an expert. Outsourcing key marketing tasks
  can free up your time and improve your strategy’s chances of success.\r

  \r

  \r

  5. Start small and scale up\r

  A good digital marketing strategy layers both short-term and long-term tactics
  so they work in tandem. That said, throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what
  sticks isn’t going to be the key to success in this scenario. Spreading
  yourself thin with too many tactics can lead to frustration and poor results.
  \r

  \r

  \r

  Start by focusing on one or two strategies that align with your goals and
  resources. Once you’ve mastered them and they’re running well, return to this
  list to pick your next traffic-driving tactic to expand your marketing mix. \r

  \r

  \r

  6. Measure and adapt\r

  Every few months, you’ll want to sit down and evaluate the performance of your
  marketing tactics. Your primary tool for doing so will be your website
  analytics. If you’re a Shopify user, you have website analytics reports that
  tell you how your digital marketing strategy is performing, according to
  traffic as well as by more direct metrics like average order value, website
  engagement, and percentage of traffic that comes from first-time customers.\r

  \r

  \r

  Depending on your strategy, you may also want to employ other tools. For
  example, if you’re embarking on an SEO strategy, you’ll want to use SEO tools
  like Google Analytics or Google Search Console. Tools like these can help you
  automate the website analytics process and more easily gain insights into your
  marketing campaigns.\r

  \r

  \r

  Analyze whether your chosen strategy is meeting your initial goal. If your
  goal was to get higher-paying customers, but you’re seeing a strong influx of
  first-time customers on that marketing channel, it might be time to
  deprioritize that strategy and choose one that better aligns with your
  objectives.\r

  \r

  \r

  More website traffic equals more customers\r

  Increasing website traffic starts with picking a marketing strategy and a
  relevant marketing channel. Remember, a good digital marketing strategy is
  about using short-term and long-term tactics in conjunction. Once you feel
  like you’ve mastered one, come back to this list and pick your next
  traffic-driving tactic.\r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  Additionally, invest in high-quality, engaging content to encourage shares and
  build backlinks. Consider running targeted pay-per-click advertising campaigns
  and collaborating with influencers to extend your reach. Site speed
  optimization, mobile-friendliness, listing your site in online directories,
  and engaging in guest blogging are also effective strategies to boost website
  visits.\r

  \r

  \r

  How can I drive traffic to my website for free?\r

  You can increase website organic traffic by leveraging some of these free
  website marketing strategies: \r

  \r

  \r

  Build a loyal follower base, boost engagement, and grow your reach by
  regularly posting valuable social content that resolves common issues or
  provides insightful information relevant to your audience. \r

  Keep your audience informed and engaged with your brand and products by
  growing and nurturing an email list.\r

  Increase brand visibility by participating in conversations with relevant
  online communities and forums.\r

  Improve your organic search rankings by utilizing SEO strategies.\r

  Tap into new audiences by guest blogging.\r

  How do I drive organic traffic to my website?\r

  Driving organic traffic to your website hinges on optimizing your content for
  search engines—a tactic known as search engine optimization (SEO). Begin by
  identifying key terms and phrases that your target audience searches for, and
  create relevant, high-quality content to answer those search queries.
  Regularly updating your website with fresh, relevant content will keep your
  audience coming back and signal to search engines that your website is a
  reliable source of information.\r

  \r

  \r

  How do I get traffic to my website fast?\r

  To quickly drive traffic to your website, invest in pay-per-click advertising
  to place links to your website in front of your target audience on search
  engines and social media platforms. This method allows you to generate
  significant traffic immediately after your ads go live.\r

  \r

  \r

  How can I use social media to drive traffic to my website?\r

  Use social media to engage your audience and link back to your website. Post
  content that appeals to your target market—such as product showcases, blog
  posts, or special offers. Include clear calls to action (CTAs) that guide
  followers to your site. Leverage paid advertising to reach a wider audience,
  and share user-generated content (UGC) to build trust and increase
  engagement.\r

  \r

  \r

  Should I focus on mobile optimization for website traffic?\r

  Yes! Since two-thirds of online purchases now come from mobile devices, mobile
  optimization is essential for your ecommerce website. Ensure your site has a
  responsive design, loads quickly, and is easy to navigate on small screens.
  Mobile-friendly features like click-to-call buttons and simplified menus can
  improve the user experience (UX) and boost conversions.\r

  10 Rules for Writing a Good Novel\r

  Written by MasterClass\r

  Last updated: Aug 9, 2021 • 6 min read\r

  The art of writing novels can seem mysterious to those who have never
  attempted such an endeavor. But seasoned authors will tell you there is
  nothing particularly secretive about the book writing process. Writing fiction
  is predicated on two main principles: creativity and discipline. Whether
  you’re a bestselling author or a ​first time writer self-publishing your first
  book, you’re in for a lot of hard work. Fortunately, if you are dedicated to
  the process, the results can be massively rewarding\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  The 10 Rules of Writing a Good Novel\r

  * 1. Read voraciously. Writers are shaped by other writers. The books we read
  as children influence our tastes and can often have an impact on our writing
  style as adults. The writers who shape us are almost like unofficial mentors:
  By reading widely and closely, young writers can learn at the feet of
  history’s most famed and beloved authors.\r

  * 2. Make checklists of details. Think about your setting and motivations for
  writing, and then make a checklist of details you want to be sure you include
  in your story. Your checklist can be a single page or it can fill a whole
  notebook. It’s not guaranteed to save you from bad writing, but it’s a very
  useful tool nonetheless. The last thing an author wants is to finish a
  manuscript and realize they’ve left out half of what motivated them to write
  in the first place.\r

  * 3. Develop good habits. Most beginning writers will have to balance their
  writing with other responsibilities. Setting aside consistent blocks of time
  for writing is an important step. Your writing time can be early in the
  morning or late at night or on your lunch hour, but keep it consistent, and
  insist on prioritizing that time. You can also experiment with having a
  dedicated writing room where you always work. This can be your dining room
  table or—if you have the space—a home office. The fact is, a good story idea
  does you little good if you don’t set aside the time to work on it, so find
  those pockets of time and space in your own life.\r

  * 4. Use your limited time wisely. Before you sit down to write, think of
  ideas, remind yourself of where you left off in the story, or make a mental
  plan for what you want to accomplish during that session. Some people strive
  to write 2,000 words a day. Others disregard word count and are more
  comfortable alternating between days spent reading, outlining, or researching.
  No matter what you choose, it’s a good idea to give yourself daily goals. This
  will prevent you from spending precious writing time staring at a blank
  page—though there are practical ways to overcome writer’s block.\r

  * 5. Build a relationship with an editor. Editors are a hugely important part
  of your publishing process. If you’re so fortunate as to command interest in
  your manuscript, you’ll want to do everything you can to ensure a good fit. A
  good editor will make you a better writer, but a bad editor can compromise
  your artistic vision. Check potential editors’ references, look at their
  backlist (prior books they’ve edited), chat with them about expectations, and
  look for a personal connection. Ask yourself what traits you value in a
  collaborative partner. A good connection between writer and editor makes a
  huge difference in the editing process.\r

  * 6. Don’t stress your first draft. Generating the first draft is an exercise
  in getting everything down that you can get down. There’s always time later to
  reassess and comb through what you’ve generated. Resist the urge to do
  repeated dives into the thesaurus or to constantly refresh your word count.
  The first draft of a book needs to arise from spontaneity. Later on, you can
  obsess over whether you chose the right word or used too many exclamation
  points. That kind of self-editing will only be needed once you have a great
  story to tell in the first place.\r

  * 7. Seek out surprises in the second draft. The second draft is all about
  finding surprises and starting to tease out the shape of your story. What
  unexpected themes or motifs have cropped up in your writing? If you like them,
  find a way to reinforce them throughout your writing. On the other hand, you
  may have to kill off a few darlings from your first draft. Fiction writing
  inherently forces you to ditch a few pet ideas or plot points, but your job as
  a writer is to serve the book, not your own emotions.\r

  * 8. Start with characters. Readers don’t pick up a book looking for a theme.
  Good fiction comes from a compelling plot and strong character development.
  This means you’ll need a main character who is complex enough to sustain a
  real character arc (including a backstory), and supporting figures who can
  motivate subplots off the main story structure.\r

  * 9. Write for art’s sake, and save the commercial analysis for later. Genre
  is a concept created by publishers and literary critics, but it’s not always a
  valuable one for the working writer. Not knowing or thinking about what genre
  your book belongs to can be valuable, because it offers you greater freedom to
  stray from genre expectations and to play with form and subject. Your job is
  to make your book the best, most compelling version of itself, plausible
  within its own imagined realm and set of rules. Let others worry about what
  genre it is. You can self-consciously try to write a horror novel, but this
  won’t necessarily make you the next Stephen King. In other words, don’t let
  genre analysis creep into your writing process. It’s hard enough to be a good
  writer without obsessing about commercial appeal, so don’t.\r

  * 10. Rules are meant to be broken. Every great writer works in a different
  way. Some writers work straight through from beginning to end. Others work in
  pieces they arrange later, while others work from sentence to sentence. Don’t
  be afraid to try out different techniques, voices, and styles. Keep what works
  for you and discard the rest. Your material and creative process will guide
  you to your own set of rules. Anything is theoretically fair game. For
  instance, you could toggle back and forth between first person and third
  person voice. You could upend grammatical correctness. Of course, this doesn’t
  mean there’s no use for the rules, it simply means fiction writers need not
  follow every one of these rules to the exact letter.\r

  Note that these rules for novel writing can apply to other forms of fiction,
  like a short story or screenplay. They aren’t even limited to fiction books:
  An engaging nonfiction book can be written under many of the same principles.
  If you keep these writing tips in mind before you start writing, you can
  maintain your own style and your own point of view while simultaneously
  employing the discipline every writer needs to successfully complete a work of
  fiction.\r

  Things You Should Know\r

  * Identify your passions, interests, and values so you can set goals based on
  things that truly matter to you.\r

  * Pursue the knowledge and skills you need to achieve your goals and maximize
  your potential.\r

  * Create a schedule to manage your time wisely. Set aside time every week to
  work on passion projects and explore new interests.\r

  *  Step 1 Live purposefully. * 1\r

  * Live purposefully. In order to achieve your dreams and be the person you
  want to be, you will have to start paying attention to your actions. Ask
  yourself, \"Is what I'm doing going to lead me to where I want to be in
  life?\"[1]\r

  \   * If you find yourself constantly bored, daydreaming about the future or
  past or counting down the minutes until the day ends, it is probably because
  you feel disconnected from what you're doing.\r

  \   * Cherish your time. Try to spend your free time doing things that you
  enjoy doing, rather than wasting time. For example, rather than spending your
  weekends watching television, spend them partaking in your hobbies or spending
  time with loved ones and new friends.\r

  \   * Measure your productivity by engagement, not achievement. Not everything
  you do has to be productive in the conventional sense, but activities should
  be engaging and enjoyable.\r

  \   * Keep in mind that it is perfectly fine to spend some time doing nothing
  and just being lazy each day. This can actually help with your imagination and
  self-awareness. Strive for a balance between doing things you want to do and
  allowing yourself to just “be.”\r

  \   *  Step 2 Identify your passions.    * 2\r

  \   * Identify your passions. Before you can achieve success, you will have to
  define what success means to you — and no one else can do that for you.[2]
  While it may take years to realize what you want to do with your life,
  identifying your passions, interests, and values will help you set goals and
  give your life a sense of meaning. If you have trouble identifying these
  things, then ask a friend or family member to help you. Ask yourself the
  following questions:\r

  \      * What do you want your legacy to be?\r

  \      * How would you like to be remembered by others?\r

  \      * How do you want to make your community a better place?\r

  \      * What are some favorite subjects of interest in your life? For
  example, think of subjects you enjoyed studying in school. Ask why you liked
  them.[3]\r

  \      * For instance, you may have loved musical theater. Think: was it
  because you loved the music, or was it because you loved working with a big
  group towards a common goal?\r

  \      *  Step 3 Make a list of your goals, and what you might do to achieve
  them.       * 3\r

  \      * Make a list of your goals, and what you might do to achieve them.[4]
  Be sure to address both short-term and long-term goals; try to think beyond
  financial and career goals, such as relationship goals, personal goals for
  bettering yourself, things you would like to experience, or things you want to
  learn. Draw up a timeline that says when you want to achieve each part.\r

  \         * Set SMART goals; goals that are specific, measurable, achievable,
  relevant, and time-bound.\r

  \         * Break big goals down. For instance, if your goal is to see the
  world, you can set the goal of saving money and visiting certain countries.\r

  \         * Reader Poll: We asked 200 wikiHow readers, and 53% of them agreed
  that they like to prioritize personal growth and self-improvement the most
  when setting personal goals. [Take Poll]\r

  \         * It's okay to start small. \"I think everyone starts in the
  mailroom at some point! It's a right of passage. Your boss has to throw
  something at you and order you around for at least two years.\"\r

  \         *  Step 4 Stick to your commitments.          * 4\r

  \         * Stick to your commitments. Planning is not sufficient; keeping
  your word is also important. If you tell someone you will do something, do it.
  Similarly, don't tell someone you will do something if you're not sure you
  can. Be honest about your limits.[5]\r

  \            * Avoid canceling plans, and try not to cancel twice on the same
  person.\r

  \            * Make commitments to yourself, and stick to them. Write down
  your commitments and hang them in places you can see.\r

  \            * Make sure that your commitments are gradually moving you
  towards your goals. Review your goals now and then to make sure you are moving
  in the right direction.\r

  Achieving\r

  \            *  Step 1 Be educated...             * 1\r

  \            * Be educated. Education gives you the knowledge, skills, and
  credibility to achieve your maximum potential. In terms of financial success,
  statistics have shown that the more education you have (i.e. the higher degree
  you achieve), the more money you are likely to make.[6]\r

  \               * In 2011, the median weekly earnings for high school
  graduates was $638 while those with bachelor's degrees made $1053. That same
  year, those with masters or doctoral degrees made $1263 and $1551
  respectively.\r

  \               * Not all education has to be formal. Apprenticeships and
  long-term training programs are also positively correlated with higher
  incomes. Obtaining a Certificate in your field can help to increase your
  salary.\r

  \               * Educate yourself for pleasure as well. The more you know
  about the world you live in, the more questions you will have and the more
  interested you will be.\r

  \               *  Step 2 Manage your finances.                * 2\r

  \               * Manage your finances. Learning how to manage your money will
  help ensure your financial stability over time, regardless of your
  income.[7]\r

  \                  * Keep track of your expenses. Subtract your monthly
  expenses from your monthly income to determine how much spending money you
  have available each month. Also, review your bank statements often and notice
  where you spend your money. This will help you prevent overspending and ensure
  that your bank statements are correct.\r

  \                  * Understand your income. When calculating your income, be
  sure to take into account the federal, state, and social security taxes that
  will be deducted from your gross pay. Don't overlook miscellaneous deductions,
  such as health insurance premiums, savings bonds and loan payments. The
  resulting number is your net pay, which is what you end up taking home with
  you.\r

  \                  * Cut back. If you are not earning enough money to cover
  your net expenses, then look into your expenses to see where you might be able
  to cut back.\r

  \                  * Save money. Every month, you should deposit some of your
  money into a savings account. Consider asking your employer to directly
  deposit a portion of your income into your savings account.\r

  \                  * Invest cautiously. If your workplace offers a retirement
  savings plan, put your excess incomes in that.\r

  \                  *  Step 3 Manage your time...                   * 3\r

  \                  * Manage your time. Putting off important tasks until the
  last minute can cause you unnecessary stress, and increase the likelihood of
  errors and negligence. Manage your time so that you have enough time to
  complete tasks effectively.[8]\r

  \                     * Use a planner to help keep you organized throughout
  the day, week, and month.\r

  \                     * Set reminders on your smart phone and make use of its
  electronic timer for better time management.\r

  \                     * Make a list of all the things you need to do in a
  given day, and check off each task as you complete it. This will help you stay
  organized and motivated.\r

  Achieving Internal Succes Step 1 Enjoy the present moment. \r

  \                     * 1\r

  \                     * Enjoy the present moment. If you are constantly
  dwelling on the past or daydreaming about the future, you are missing out on
  the present moment. Remember that the past and the future are simply
  illusions, and that real life takes place here and now.\r

  \                     * Start paying attention to negative thoughts so that
  you can move on from them and enjoy the present moment. If a negative thought
  arises in your head, then acknowledge it, label it a negative thought, and
  then let it fade away.[9] Regular meditation or mindfulness exercises can help
  to make this feel more natural for you.\r

  \                     * Get in the habit of paying attention to small details
  around you. Appreciate the feeling of the sun on your skin, the sensation of
  your feet walking on the ground, or the artwork in the restaurant you are
  eating in. Noticing things like these will help you silence a rambling mind
  and appreciate every moment.\r

  \                     *  Step 2 Don't compare your own life to other peoples'
  lives.                      * 2\r

  \                     * Don't compare your own life to other peoples' lives.
  Unfortunately, many people measure their own success by comparing it to the
  success of those around them. If you want to feel accomplished and happy, you
  will have to value your life for its own sake.\r

  \                        * Many people have the tendency to compare the low
  points of their own lives with the high points of other peoples' lives.
  Remember that no matter how perfect somebody's life may seem, behind closed
  doors everybody deals with tragedy, insecurity, and other difficulties.[10]
  Pay attention to and limit your use of social media to help you remember
  this.\r

  \                        * Rather than comparing yourself with people who are
  \"better off\" than you, think about all of the people who are homeless,
  chronically ill, or living in poverty. This will help you appreciate what you
  have rather than feeling sorry for yourself. Try engaging in volunteer work to
  help make this more apparent. This can help to boost your happiness and
  confidence as well.\r

  \                        *  Step 3 Count your
  blessings.                         * 3\r

  \                        * Count your blessings. No matter how much you
  achieve in life, you will always feel unhappy if you constantly focus on what
  you don't have. Instead, devote time every day to appreciating the things you
  do have. Think beyond material items; appreciate your loved ones, and cherish
  happy memories.\r

  \                           * This is also important when thinking about the
  future. Instead of fearing what might happen, try to be excited for the new
  experiences you will have.[11]\r

  \                           *  Step 1 Look after your
  health                            * 1\r

  \                           * Look after your health. A healthy body supports
  a healthy mind. Eat a balanced diet and ensure that you aren't lacking in any
  necessary nutrients. Establish the cause of any problems you may experience,
  such as a lack of energy or a lack of concentration and deal with them by
  discussing with a doctor, nutritionist and related health professionals. Get
  plenty of exercise too but make your fitness choices according to what you
  enjoy.\r

  \                           *  Step 2 Follow up on
  opportunities.                            * 2\r

  \                           * Follow up on opportunities. If you have a chance
  to shine, take it. If you are worried you won't have time and energy for a
  good opportunity, ask yourself: would this contribute to my end goals? If it
  would, then get rid of other commitments in order to pursue this
  opportunity.\r

  \                              * Remember, some chances only come around once.
  You can't bank them.\r

  \                              * This doesn't mean you should throw away all
  your savings or get rid of your safety net. It just means you should say yes
  when you are given an offer to move ahead.\r

  \                              *  Step 3 Surround yourself with positive
  people.                               * 3\r

  \                              * Surround yourself with positive people. Make
  friends with people you admire for various reasons: because they are happy,
  kind, generous, successful at work, or successful in other ways. Join forces
  with those who have achieved things you want to achieve, or who are on their
  way to a common goal. Don't let jealousy get in your way: nobody's success is
  a threat to yours.[12]\r

  \                                 * When making friends with someone, ask
  yourself if the person makes you feel motivated, positive, and confident, or
  if they make you feel tired, overwhelmed, or incompetent. Choose to spend time
  with the positive people, not the ones sucking your energy.\r

  \                                 * If you have friends or family members who
  always make you feel bad about yourself, limit the time you spend with them.
  Also, make sure to identify relationships that are not helping you to move
  towards your goals, that stress you out, or that require too much of your time
  and energy without being reciprocal.\r

  \                                 * Look for mentors among the people you
  admire. If you think you could learn from someone, ask for their advice.\r

  \                                 * Set boundaries with others. Advocate for
  your own needs. Be caring towards others, but don't accept abuse from anyone.
  Remember, being a good person does not mean you have to take violent or
  disrespectful language or actions from anyone.[13]\r

  \                                    * Respect the boundaries others set for
  you, too. Listen to your loved ones when they tell you they need space, or
  want to do something alone.\r

  For some, \"success\" means finding a sustainable career that enables them to
  support themselves and their families. For others, \"success\" means healing
  from or successfully managing a chronic illness. Still for others, \"success\"
  means owning a thriving business and donating to their community of choice.
  John Wooden said it best—\"Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result
  of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are
  capable of becoming.\"\r

  Tips\r

  \                                       * Having positive role models in your
  life can help keep you motivated and lead you in the right direction. Your
  role model may or may not be somebody you know personally. Learn about your
  role model's life story and try to adopt their work ethic.\r

  \                                       * Keep yourself inspired by anything
  that inspires you: music, photography, fashion, current events, etc. Nothing
  else ignites a flame in you like a great source of inspiration.\r

  Tips from our Readers \r

  \                                       * Use planners, calendars, and to-do
  lists to schedule important tasks and passion projects. Checking off completed
  items gives a sense of progress and motivation. But avoid overscheduling
  yourself. Leave time for flexibility and self-care.\r

  \                                       * Build relationships with positive,
  supportive people who share your core values and lift you up. Their energy can
  inspire you to keep pursuing your dreams. Limit time with those who undermine
  your goals or drain your energy unnecessarily.\r

  \                                       * Make a list of your core values and
  true passions first. Then set S.M.A.R.T. goals aligned with them. This
  provides meaning and fulfillment beyond just money or status. Define success
  based on your own fulfillment, not others' standards.\r

  \                                       * Stay focused on enjoying the journey
  rather than fixating only on distant end goals. Appreciate small joys and
  blessings in each present moment. True contentment comes from within, not
  external validation.\r

  \                                       * Regularly count your blessings
  during wins and losses alike. Maintain perspective by remembering everyone's
  life has ups and downs. Focus daily gratitude on what you have, rather than
  what you lack.\r

  \                                       * Break large goals down into smaller,
  manageable steps. Then make consistent progress each day through
  self-discipline. Always honor commitments made to yourself and others. Meet
  your own standa"
