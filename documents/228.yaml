  Overview\r

  \r

  \r

  Software Licensing Agreements set forth the terms by which licensees can use
  proprietary software developed by the licensor. Software Licensing Agreements
  are crucial for software developers to protect the time and resources they put
  into creating software. By licensing, rather than selling, software,
  developers can retain ownership rights and (theoretically) control
  distribution while disclaiming warranties and limiting their liability
  surrounding the software. \r

  \r

  \r

  Software Licensing Agreements will vary based upon the nature of the software
  being licensed but some of the most important clauses address terms of
  installation, upgrades, bug fixes, transferability and warranties. \r
