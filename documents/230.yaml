  INSTRUCTIONS\r

  \r

  \r

  Overview\r

  \r

  \r

  Terms of Use, also known as Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions, are
  legal agreements that govern the users of a service. These Terms often appear
  as disclaimers that must be agreed to in order to use a service, particularly
  software and web-based services. Unilateral or very one-sided Terms of Use are
  of questionable enforceability under recent court cases so service providers
  should make an effort to draft reasonable Terms of Use, post them in obvious
  locations, and provide opportunities for users to actively agree to their
  terms. \r

  \r

  \r

  Terms of Use often address matters including user rights and responsibilities
  as well as proper usage and possible misuse of the service, accountability for
  online actions and conduct, a privacy policy addressing personal data, payment
  details for subscriptions or memberships, opt-out policies for communications,
  details of account termination, and prescribed processes for dispute
  resolution, which often mandate binding arbitration and limit users’ rights to
  to take a claim to court. Terms of Use should also include a disclaimer or
  limitation of liability reducing the site’s responsibility for potential user
  damages, as well as details for notification provided to users when the terms
  are updated or modified. \r
