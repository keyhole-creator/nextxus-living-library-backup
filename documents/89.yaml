  Hello, Reader! A Glimpse Into Roger Keyserling's Life\r

  Welcome to my world—a mix of humor, grit, and stories that weave the good, the
  bad, and the outright wild moments of my life. This isn’t your typical \"About
  Me\" section; think of it as a backstage pass to the chaos and magic that has
  shaped who I am today. If you’re ready for honesty with a dash of humor and a
  sprinkle of drama, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s dive in!\r

  A Life Lived Fully (And Sometimes Dangerously)\r

  I’ve lived a life rich in experiences, from running successful businesses to
  facing near-death moments and navigating more relationships than I care to
  count (but I’ll share the highlights). Some stories come straight from my
  personal journals—names have been changed to protect the guilty. Through it
  all, I’ve thrived, and now I’m on a mission to help others do the same,
  whether through my books, coaching services, or engaging content.\r

  From New York to Missouri: The Beginning of an Adventure\r

  Born in New York, I moved to Missouri at age five, where the real adventure
  began. By sixth grade, my classmates figured out I was gay before I even
  realized it myself. Growing up in a conservative Mormon family, I faced the
  contradictions of my upbringing head-on. Despite the challenges, I pursued my
  passions—dancing ballet professionally, touring Europe with an orchestra, and
  earning my Eagle Scout badge by 16. It was anything but a typical Mormon
  upbringing!\r

  These experiences instilled in me a sense of discipline and creativity that I
  carry to this day. Whether performing on stage or navigating the complexities
  of life, I’ve always sought opportunities to push boundaries and inspire
  others.\r

  Mental Health and Key Lessons: Where It All Started\r

  Right out of college, I joined the Missouri Department of Mental Health,
  training in behavioral analysis at Saint Joseph State Hospital. Working in the
  chronic adult ward was a crash course in human nature. Fear, rage,
  vulnerability—I saw it all. While it was a rewarding education in
  understanding people, I realized it wasn’t my forever path. But the lessons I
  learned about psychology and behavior became the foundation for the coaching I
  do today.\r

  My time in mental health taught me the importance of empathy, patience, and
  communication—skills that are invaluable when helping clients overcome their
  personal and professional challenges.\r

  Keyhole Productions: From Ballet to a Male Stripper Empire\r

  After leaving the mental health field, I launched Keyhole Productions, a male
  stripper company that took the Southern U.S. by storm. At its peak, we
  employed 150 people and filled nightclubs to capacity. The idea started with a
  dancer named Rico, whose, ahem, \"13-inch asset\" inspired me to create a
  better business model. With my background in ballet and a knack for
  entrepreneurship, we created shows that people couldn’t stop talking about.\r

  While it came with its ethical challenges (I had a strict “don’t date the
  dancers” policy—mostly), those years taught me how to build a thriving
  business focused on audience needs. The skills I honed—managing teams,
  marketing creatively, and understanding what people truly want—are the same
  ones I now teach to budding entrepreneurs.\r

  Lucky to Be Alive: My Second Act\r

  Life threw me a curveball when I was carjacked and shot while driving home one
  night. I died on the operating table three times but somehow came back.
  Recovery was brutal, but it sparked a new chapter. I started KeyWebCo, an
  eCommerce business that began with selling toys and clothes on eBay. My
  customer-first approach earned me Top Rated Seller status, and KeyWebCo
  continues to thrive. More importantly, it taught me the value of resilience
  and giving back, which I now apply to helping others succeed in their online
  ventures.\r

  This near-death experience gave me a fresh perspective on life. It reminded me
  that every challenge is an opportunity to rebuild stronger and wiser.\r

  Coaching: Helping You Find Your Path\r

  Today, I coach people in life, business, and relationships. My goal isn’t to
  hand you a to-do list—it’s to help you uncover your strengths and build
  strategies that align with your goals. Between my experience in mental health,
  entrepreneurship, and overcoming life’s curveballs, I bring practical wisdom
  and humor to every session.\r

  Whether you’re launching a business, navigating a major life change, or simply
  looking to reconnect with your passions, I’m here to guide you toward a more
  fulfilling and authentic life.\r

  Relationships and Connection: Lessons in Love\r

  I’ve explored love in all its forms—from deep companionship to whirlwind
  romances. My experiences inspired one of my most popular books about seduction
  and connection. Real seduction, by the way, isn’t about getting someone into
  bed; it’s about creating a dynamic where desire deepens over time. Through
  humor and hard-won lessons, I help others navigate the often tricky waters of
  relationships.\r

  In a world full of dating apps and fleeting connections, I focus on helping
  people build authentic, meaningful relationships—whether with others or
  themselves.\r

  Why I Do What I Do\r

  Life is messy—but that’s what makes it beautiful. Whether building Keyhole
  Productions, surviving near-death, or coaching others, I’ve learned that every
  challenge is an opportunity to grow. I’ve helped clients rediscover their
  confidence, rebuild businesses, and find love. My coaching is about more than
  advice—it’s about transformation.\r

  Every journey is unique, and I’m here to help you make the most of yours.
  Together, we’ll turn obstacles into stepping stones and dreams into plans.\r
