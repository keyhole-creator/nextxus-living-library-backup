full_text: "﻿Love is a multifaceted concept that is interpreted and experienced
  differently depending on cultural, psychological, philosophical, biological,
  and spiritual perspectives. Here’s a deep dive into various viewpoints on what
  love really is.\r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  \r

  1. Psychological Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  From a psychological standpoint, love can be understood as a powerful emotion,
  often encompassing attachment, care, passion, and commitment. Psychologists
  identify different types of love based on these emotional components:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Attachment Theory: Psychologists view love as a bond rooted
  in early childhood experiences. Secure, anxious, or avoidant attachment styles
  developed in childhood tend to influence how people form relationships later
  in life. Those with secure attachment are often better at fostering healthy
  relationships, whereas insecure attachments can lead to codependency or fear
  of intimacy.\r

  \        •        Sternberg’s Triangular Theory of Love: Psychologist Robert
  Sternberg proposed that love comprises three components: intimacy, passion,
  and commitment. Different combinations of these elements result in various
  types of love (e.g., romantic love, companionate love, infatuation). True,
  lasting love often involves a balance of all three.\r

  \        •        Love as a Social Construct: Some psychologists argue that
  love is shaped by societal norms and cultural conditioning, suggesting that
  people learn “how to love” based on expectations and media portrayals rather
  than innate feelings.\r

  \r

  \r

  2. Philosophical Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Philosophers have pondered the nature of love for centuries, often seeking to
  understand its meaning and purpose in human life:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Platonic Love: Plato distinguished between physical love
  (eros) and a higher form of love (agape), which transcends physical attraction
  and is rooted in shared intellectual or spiritual connections. Platonic love
  values the essence of a person, viewing love as a path to discovering truth
  and virtue.\r

  \        •        Existential Love: Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre saw
  love as a way to affirm one’s existence, where individuals are drawn together
  in an attempt to find meaning in a world that can often seem meaningless. In
  this view, love is both liberating and a challenge to our personal freedom, as
  it requires vulnerability and surrender to another.\r

  \        •        Love as Union: Philosophers like Arthur Schopenhauer saw
  love as an illusion created by biology to propagate the species. In contrast,
  others, such as Martin Buber, viewed love as an authentic connection with
  another person, a “meeting” of two beings that brings about self-awareness and
  profound unity.\r

  \r

  \r

  3. Biological and Evolutionary Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Biologists and neuroscientists often explain love in terms of chemistry and
  evolutionary biology:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Neurochemistry: Love triggers a cascade of neurotransmitters
  like dopamine (pleasure), oxytocin (bonding), and serotonin (happiness). Early
  stages of attraction increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels, causing
  excitement and pleasure. Long-term attachment is associated with oxytocin and
  vasopressin, hormones that promote bonding and loyalty.\r

  \        •        Evolutionary Purpose: From an evolutionary perspective, love
  is viewed as a survival mechanism. Romantic love, driven by passion and
  attraction, encourages procreation, while companionate love promotes bonding
  and cooperation necessary for raising offspring. This theory suggests love
  evolved to ensure the survival of the species by fostering long-term
  partnerships.\r

  \r

  \r

  4. Cultural Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Cultural norms and traditions play a significant role in shaping perceptions
  and experiences of love. Different cultures often have unique views on love,
  relationships, and expressions of affection:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Western vs. Eastern Views: In Western cultures, love is
  often romanticized, depicted as a highly personal choice driven by individual
  desire and passion. In contrast, many Eastern cultures view love within the
  context of family and societal harmony, with arranged marriages and duty to
  family taking precedence over individual romantic love.\r

  \        •        Types of Love in Language: Some languages, such as Greek,
  have multiple words for different types of love, illustrating the varied ways
  it is experienced:\r

  \        •        Eros: Passionate, often sexual love.\r

  \        •        Philia: Affectionate love or friendship.\r

  \        •        Storge: Familial love.\r

  \        •        Agape: Unconditional, selfless love.\r

  \        •        Ludus: Playful, flirtatious love.\r

  \        •        Pragma: Practical love that matures over time.\r

  \r

  \r

  5. Religious and Spiritual Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Many religious and spiritual traditions view love as central to human life,
  often seeing it as a divine or sacred experience:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Christianity: In Christianity, love is a reflection of God’s
  love for humanity. Jesus’s teachings emphasize “agape” love—selfless,
  sacrificial love—as the highest form of love. This love is viewed as a moral
  duty and often extends to all beings, promoting compassion, forgiveness, and
  altruism.\r

  \        •        Hinduism: Hindu philosophy sees love (prema or bhakti) as a
  path toward self-realization and union with the divine. Bhakti yoga is the
  practice of devotion to God, where love is directed not only toward others but
  also as a way to connect with the divine spirit within oneself.\r

  \        •        Buddhism: In Buddhism, love is linked with “metta”
  (loving-kindness) and “karuna” (compassion). Buddhism teaches the cultivation
  of unconditional love for all beings, as a way to transcend ego and achieve
  inner peace. Romantic love is often seen as attachment and desire, which can
  lead to suffering if not balanced with wisdom and compassion.\r

  \r

  \r

  6. Modern Sociological Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Contemporary sociology examines love within the context of social change,
  technology, and shifting relationship structures:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        The Role of Technology: Digital platforms and social media
  have transformed how people experience love. Apps like Tinder and Grindr
  introduce new ways to form connections, yet also influence expectations and
  perceptions of love. Some argue that these platforms commodify love, turning
  it into a product to be swiped or chosen, while others see it as a way to
  broaden opportunities for connection.\r

  \        •        Polyamory and Non-Monogamy: Modern society increasingly
  recognizes non-traditional relationship structures, including polyamory and
  open relationships. Love, in this context, is viewed as expansive and
  non-exclusive, challenging traditional monogamous ideals. Advocates argue that
  love is not limited by exclusivity and that multiple partnerships can coexist
  with healthy communication and respect.\r

  \        •        Postmodern Love: Sociologists such as Zygmunt Bauman suggest
  that love has become “liquid” in contemporary society, meaning it is flexible
  and transient. In an era where individual autonomy is highly valued,
  relationships are often viewed as temporary and changeable, with individuals
  prioritizing personal growth and self-fulfillment over long-term commitment.\r

  \r

  \r

  7. Humanistic Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  Humanistic psychology, developed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, sees love
  as essential to personal development and self-actualization:\r

  \r

  \r

  \        •        Unconditional Positive Regard: According to Carl Rogers,
  healthy love involves “unconditional positive regard,” meaning love and
  acceptance without judgment or conditions. This type of love fosters personal
  growth and self-acceptance, allowing people to become the best versions of
  themselves.\r

  \        •        Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Maslow considered love and
  belonging as central to human motivation, placing them as essential for
  personal well-being. The need for love, in his view, is not merely romantic
  but encompasses family, friendships, and community. Fulfillment in love
  supports self-esteem, ultimately leading to self-actualization.\r

  \r

  \r

  8. Personal and Individual Perspective\r

  \r

  \r

  On a personal level, love is subjective and often defined uniquely by each
  person’s experiences, needs, and beliefs. For some, love is the feeling of
  warmth and security that comes from family or a lifelong partner; for others,
  it may be the thrill of passion, the bond of deep friendship, or the joy of
  helping others.\r

  \r

  \r

  Personal definitions of love are often shaped by past relationships, personal
  values, and life experiences. Each individual’s concept of love evolves over
  time, influenced by their journey through life, their worldview, and their
  ongoing emotional growth.\r

  \r

  \r

  Conclusion\r

  \r

  \r

  Love, from its passionate highs to its selfless sacrifices, is a universal yet
  deeply personal experience. It’s simultaneously a biochemical reaction, a
  social construct, a spiritual journey, and a psychological bond. Each
  viewpoint—be it psychological, philosophical, biological, or
  spiritual—captures only a facet of love’s vast complexity. Ultimately, love’s
  meaning may lie in the convergence of these perspectives, reflecting the depth
  of human connection and our desire toSure, “true love” sounds great, but what
  does it really mean? DailyOM talked with experts to better understand the
  concept and what it entails, and what true love looks like between romantic
  partners.\r

  Love is, well, wonderful. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. It feels
  good to give it and receive it. There are many forms of love: romantic love,
  transformative love between a parent and a child, the strong connection
  between friends or family members, and, for many people, the uncomplicated
  bond they have with their beloved pets. Though love is powerful in many
  different forms, here DailyOM explores true love as it pertains to romantic
  partnerships.\r

  What does “true love” actually mean? And how do you know if you have it? To
  answer these questions and more, DailyOM talked to relationship experts to
  better understand this hard-to-define concept.\r

  DailyOM Journal - What Is Love?\r

  What does true love look like to you? Michelle Vartan, editor-in-chief of
  DailyOM Journal, asks people to share their definition of love.\r

  Defining True Love Between Romantic Partners\r

  According to experts, the definition of true love differs depending on the
  relationship. In romantic relationships, where you’ll most often hear the term
  “true love” used, it can be defined as “the combination of emotional,
  physical, and sexual connection” coupled with a consistent liking and
  fondness, says Juliana Hauser, PhD, a licensed marriage and family therapist
  and licensed professional counselor. This feeling stands out from the
  connections you have with other people.\r

  Dr. Hauser tells DailyOM that true love in the romantic sense is complicated.
  “It is both constant and changing,” she says. “It is long-lasting as well as a
  fresh feeling.”\r

  Darcy Sterling, PhD, a licensed clinical social worker based in New York City,
  echoes this notion of ever-evolving love. “Love begins as an emotion and, over
  time, it grows into a verb,” she explains. “It becomes the acts of love that
  you engage in. If you’re performing them, you are loving. And if you’re not,
  you are neglecting.”\r

  This is why, Dr. Sterling says, some romantic relationships fall out of love
  because they’re no longer engaging in those behaviors they did in the
  beginning that caused them to fall in love.\r

  The Power of Unconditional Love\r

  Hauser says that true love is simply love in a higher form, regardless of the
  relationship (romantic, between parent and child, or between friends and
  family members). To feel loved boils down to feeling understood by another
  person, says Sterling. “It’s the feeling that another person gets you,” she
  says. For instance, some people may say their mother knows them like no one
  else can or ever will. “It’s the attunement of another,” Sterling adds. “It
  doesn’t mean we agree on things. It means that we are loved and accepted
  despite our differences. Love is a feeling of being accepted.”\r

  What Does True Love Look and Feel Like? \r

  True love has a certain look and feel. For starters, Hauser says, true love
  feels safe and allows each person to be emotionally vulnerable and ask for
  their needs to be met. “Each person feels heard and feels room to be who they
  are authentically,” she explains.\r

  \ \r

  Love begins as an emotion and, over time, it grows into a verb.\r

  \ \r

  Even when there is conflict — as there is in all relationships — when there is
  true love, you still feel a sense of calmness, and safety is still palpable,
  says Hauser.\r

  This level of safety may feel unusual for some people if it’s not something
  they’ve experienced before, Sterling explains. There is a deep sense of
  comfort between the two people when they’re in each other’s company, the
  expert goes on to say. “Imagine a Venn diagram that shows two people — each
  allowed to be their own unique person — and the overlap, which represents the
  relationship space, is also a place of comfort and acceptance,” she says. That
  sense of comfort may also mean you feel more inclined to do things for the
  other person that are out of character for you, and you may notice you’re more
  patient than usual.\r

  Deep intimacy is another key component of true love, and between romantic
  partners, that deep intimacy extends physically. “You feel drawn equally to
  wanting to know that person and have them know you,” Hauser says. “In romantic
  true love, there is a nonverbal dance of physical contact.”\r

  Hauser says true love also manifests as having an underlying positive regard
  for each other, feeling a sense of urgency to share both good and bad news
  with them first, thinking about them differently (often with a smile), and an
  inner knowing that you can’t imagine not having the person in your life. All
  in all, you feel content when you think about the relationship, Sterling says.
  With romantic relationships, there’s an undeniable spark.\r

  How Long Does It Take to Develop True Love?\r

  The short answer: It depends. Hauser says there isn’t a solid rule of thumb as
  it ranges significantly from person to person, especially with romantic love.
  “Some people fall into true love quickly, and for others, it’s a slow burn,”
  she says. “It depends on several items: how quickly you authentically show up
  and connect, what types of outside stressors and forces are distracting the
  connection development, and how much readiness each person has to devote
  toward love. Trauma history and relationship to safety and trust also make a
  difference and can have an impact on timing.”\r

  In other words, as Sterling sums up, the length of time it takes to develop
  true love correlates with how much inner work and healing you’ve done to be
  able to create healthy love in your life.\r

  One sign that you have true love is that you don’t have to ask yourself
  whether you love the person. You know you do. “Ultimately, true love feels
  more like an answer than a question,” Sterling says.\r

  As the adage goes, when you know, you know.\r

  \r

  \r

  \ both know and be known in a world filled with complexity and wonder.\r

  \r

  \r

  When it comes to love, some people would say it is one of the most important
  human emotions. Love is a set of emotions and behaviors characterized by
  intimacy, passion, and commitment. It involves care, closeness,
  protectiveness, attraction, affection, and trust.\r

  Many say it's not an emotion in the way we typically understand them, but an
  essential physiological drive. \r

  Love is a physiological motivation such as hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex
  drive.1\r

  — PSYCHOLOGIST AND BIOLOGIST ENRIQUE BURUNAT\r

  There are countless songs, books, poems, and other works of art about love
  (you probably have one in mind as we speak!). Yet despite being one of the
  most studied behaviors, it is still the least understood. For example,
  researchers debate whether love is a biological or cultural phenomenon."
