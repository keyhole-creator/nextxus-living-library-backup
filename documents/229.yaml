  Overview\r

  \r

  \r

  Privacy Policies are agreements that specify what type of data a website
  collects from users and how that data will be used. Known as “personal
  information” or “personally identifiable information,” regulated data
  typically includes anything that can be used to identify an individual, and is
  not limited to a user’s name. Personal information may include a user’s
  address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue and
  expiration date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where
  one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services, among others. \r

  \ \r

  While no single federal law requires that websites have a Privacy Policy, the
  sum of federal and state legislation suggest that you should. Regulations vary
  by geographical region and jurisdiction as well as by subject matter so be
  sure to check local laws when drafting your Policy. Privacy Policies should be
  updated whenever a change occurs in the way a website collects or utilizes
  user information. \r

  \r

  \r

  Consider linking your Privacy Policy with your Terms of Use to ensure cohesive
  application of relevant laws. If you would like to be more specific with your
  users, consider a Data Usage Policy or Data Usage Statement. \r
