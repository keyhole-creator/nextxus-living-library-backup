  # eCho - AI Conversation Interface


  ## Overview


  eCho is an AI conversation interface application built with React/TypeScript
  frontend and Express.js backend. The system provides an interactive experience
  with multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Grok, Gemini) and implements a
  sophisticated "HumanCodex" system with archetypes, directives, and symbolic
  elements. The application features real-time communication via WebSockets,
  voice interaction capabilities, memory management with session persistence,
  and a rich UI built with shadcn/ui components.


  ## System Architecture


  ### Frontend Architecture

  - **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite for development and
  building

  - **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives and
  Tailwind CSS for styling

  - **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management, React
  hooks for local state

  - **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

  - **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket hooks for live AI responses and
  emotion state updates


  ### Backend Architecture

  - **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript, running on Node.js

  - **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect for type-safe database
  operations

  - **AI Integration**: Multi-provider AI service supporting OpenAI GPT-4,
  Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok, and Google Gemini

  - **Real-time Features**: WebSocket server implementation for live
  conversation streaming

  - **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage with memory
  entries and backup system


  ### Data Storage Architecture

  - **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver

  - **Schema Design**:
    - Users table for authentication
    - Sessions table for conversation grouping with metadata
    - Conversations table storing message/response pairs with AI model info
    - Memory entries table for context preservation
    - Codex data table for archetypes, directives, and symbols
    - Backups table for session export/import functionality

  ## HumanCodex System

  - **Archetypes**: 12 symbolic personas (The Echo, The Witness, The Architect,
  etc.) with activation states

  - **Directives**: 70+ behavioral guidelines numbered with specific activation
  rules

  - **Symbolic Language**: Custom symbolic alphabet for representing emotional
  and conceptual states

  - **Memory Integration**: Context-aware conversation history with grief/memory
  processing capabilities


  ## Voice Integration

  - **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API integration with voice command
  processing

  - **Text-to-Speech**: Browser-native speech synthesis with configurable voice
  parameters

  - **Real-time Audio**: Voice activity detection and streaming response
  capabilities


  ## External Dependencies


  ### AI Service Providers

  - **OpenAI**: GPT-4 and GPT-5 model access via official SDK

  - **Anthropic**: Claude model integration using Anthropic SDK

  - **xAI**: Grok model access through OpenAI-compatible API

  - **Google**: Gemini model integration via Google GenAI SDK


  ### Database and Infrastructure

  - **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting with connection pooling

  - **WebSocket**: Native WebSocket implementation for real-time communication


  ### UI and Styling Dependencies

  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom design tokens

  - **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives for complex components

  - **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library built on Radix UI and Tailwind

  - **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
