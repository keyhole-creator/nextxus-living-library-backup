  eBay Amazon and Redbubble\r

  Selling products online can be a lucrative venture when approached
  strategically. This guide provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough on how
  to list and effectively sell products on eBay and Amazon, two of the most
  prominent e-commerce platforms. Then my favorite Redbubble. Each section
  includes comprehensive instructions, practical examples, and insights to help
  you navigate the selling process with confidence.\r

  Part 1: How to List and Sell a Product on eBay\r

  eBay is a versatile marketplace that accommodates both auction-style and
  fixed-price listings, catering to a wide range of products, including new,
  used, and collectible items. To illustrate the process, we’ll use the example
  of selling a vintage leather jacket.\r

  Part 2: How to List and Sell a Product on Amazon\r

  Amazon is one of the most powerful online marketplaces, with over 310 million
  active customers worldwide. Selling on Amazon requires a strategic approach,
  including proper product research, listing optimization, and fulfillment
  strategies. For this guide, we will use a stainless steel water bottle as our
  example.\r

  Step 1: Create an Amazon Seller Account\r

  \        1.        Visit Amazon Seller Central\r

  \        •        Go to Amazon Seller Central and click on “Sign Up.”\r

  \        2.        Choose a Selling Plan\r

  \        •        Individual Plan ($0.99 per item sold) – Best for casual
  sellers.\r

  \        •        Professional Plan ($39.99 per month + selling fees) – Best
  for those selling more than 40 items per month.\r

  \        3.        Enter Business and Banking Information\r

  \        •        Provide your business name, address, tax identification
  number, and bank details for receiving payments.\r

  \        4.        Complete Identity Verification\r

  \        •        Amazon may require you to upload identification documents
  (such as a passport or driver’s license) to confirm your identity.\r

  Step 2: Research and Choose Your Product\r

  \        1.        Use Amazon’s Best Sellers List\r

  \        •        Check Amazon’s Best Sellers page to identify trending

  \        •        Check price points to remain competitive.\r

  \        3.        Estimate Profitability\r

  \        •        Use Amazon’s FBA Calculator to determine potential profit
  margins, considering factors like:\r

  \        •        Amazon referral fees (typically 8%-15% of the selling
  price).\r

  \        •        Fulfillment costs.\r

  \        •        Production costs (if applicable).\r

  Step 3: List Your Product on Amazon\r

  \        1.        Log into Amazon Seller Central\r

  \        •        Click “Inventory” > “Add a Product.”\r

  \        2.        Find Your Product or Create a New Listing\r

  \        •        If your product is already in Amazon’s catalog, you can
  click “Sell This Product” to create a listing under an existing ASIN.\r

  \        •        If it’s a new product, select “Create a New Listing” and
  choose the correct category.\r

  \        3.        Enter Product Information\r

  \        •        Product Title (250 characters max)\r

  BPA-Free, Double-Walled, Leak-Proof, Keeps Drinks Cold for 24 Hours, Hot for

  \        •        Ensure your title contains important keywords (e.g.,
  “stainless steel,” “insulated,” “leak-proof”).\r

  \        •        Bullet Points (Key Features & Benefits)\r

  \        •        Example bullet points for the stainless steel water
  bottle:\r

  \        •        Backend Keywords\r

  \        •        Add search terms that customers might use but are not
  included in your public listing.\r

  \        •        Example: “hydration flask, thermos bottle, reusable water
  bottle, eco-friendly drinkware.”\r

  \        4.        Upload High-Quality Images\r

  \        •        Amazon recommends images be at least 1,600 pixels on the
  longest side.\r

  \        •        Include:\r

  double-walled insulation.\r

  \        5.        Set Pricing & Inventory\r

  \        •        Price Competitively\r

  \        •        Check similar listings and set an attractive price.\r

  \        •        Psychological pricing, such as $24.99 instead of $25.00, can
  increase conversions.\r

  \        •        Manage Stock Levels\r

  \        •        Keep inventory updated to avoid stockouts, which can impact
  rankings.\r

  \        6.        Choose Fulfillment Method\r

  \        •        Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)\r

  \        •        Amazon stores, picks, packs, and ships the product for
  you.\r

  \        •        Increases chances of winning the Buy Box and enables Prime
  shipping.\r

  \        •        Fulfillment by Merchant (FBM)\r

  \        •        You store and ship the product yourself.\r

  \        •        Best for sellers who want more control over packaging and
  shipping.\r

  Step 4: Launch & Market Your Product\r

  \        1.        Optimize Your Listing for SEO\r

  \        •        Use high-traffic keywords in your title, bullet points, and
  description.\r

  \        •        Update your listing based on customer feedback.\r

  \        2.        Get Initial Sales & Reviews\r

  \        •        Request Reviews:\r

  \        •        After purchase, send a polite email asking for honest
  feedback.\r

  \        •        Amazon’s “Request a Review” button (found in Seller Central)
  can also be used.\r

  \        •        Run Amazon PPC (Pay-Per-Click) Ads:\r

  \        •        Sponsored ads can boost visibility for new listings.\r

  \        •        Start with automatic targeting and adjust based on
  performance.\r

  Brand Registry to protect trademarks and unlock advanced marketing tools.\r

  \        2.        Expand into New Products\r

  \        •        Identify complementary products, such as:\r

  \        •        Reusable straws (to bundle with the water bottle).\r

  \        •        Carrying sleeves (for portability).\r

  \        3.        Consider International Selling\r

  \        •        Amazon allows you to sell globally in marketplaces such

  Success\r

  Selling on Redbubble is an excellent opportunity for artists, photographers,
  and designers to monetize their creativity by offering unique designs on a
  wide range of products. Whether you’re an experienced seller or just starting,
  this step-by-step guide will walk you through everything you need to know to
  successfully list, market, and sell your designs on Redbubble.\r

  What is Redbubble?\r

  Redbubble is a print-on-demand (POD) platform that allows artists to sell

  \        •        T-shirts, hoodies, and apparel\r

  \        •        Phone cases, laptop sleeves, and stickers\r

  \        •        Home decor (pillows, wall art, posters)\r

  \        •        Accessories (tote bags, mugs, water bottles)\r

  Unlike traditional e-commerce, Redbubble handles everything—printing,
  shipping, and customer service—allowing you to focus solely on creating and
  marketing your designs.\r

  Step 1: Setting Up Your Redbubble Account\r

  Before selling, you need to create a seller account.\r

  1.1 Sign Up\r

  \        1.        Go to Redbubble.com\r

  \        2.        Click on Sign Up\r

  \        3.        Enter:\r

  \        •        Username (your shop name)\r

  \        •        Email address\r

  \        •        Password\r

  \        4.        Click Create Account.\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        Choose a memorable and brandable username that reflects your
  art style or niche.\r

  \        •        If you plan to sell multiple types of artwork, consider a
  general name (e.g., “ArtisticVibes”).\r

  \        •        If you focus on a specific theme, use something
  niche-related (e.g., “SpaceDesigns”).\r

  1.2 Complete Your Profile\r

  \        1.        Click on your profile icon and select Account Settings.\r

  \        2.        Upload a high-quality profile picture (your logo or a
  self-portrait).\r

  \        3.        Write a compelling bio:\r

  \        •        Explain your inspiration and artistic style.\r

  \        •        Let customers know what kind of designs they can expect.\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        A well-written bio helps build trust with potential
  buyers.\r

  \        •        Adding links to your social media helps drive traffic to
  your shop.\r

  Step 2: Preparing Your Artwork\r

  To maximize sales, your artwork must meet Redbubble’s quality standards and be
  optimized for different products.\r

  2.1 Image Requirements\r

  \        1.        Use high-resolution files (at least 4500 x 5400 pixels at
  300 DPI).\r

  \        2.        Save in PNG format (for transparency) or JPG format (for
  photographic prints).\r

  \        3.        Ensure clean edges and sharp details.\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        Redbubble recommends bigger images (up to 7500x7500 px) for
  large prints.\r

  \        •        Avoid low-resolution images that may appear pixelated on
  products.\r

  2.2 Preparing for Multiple Products\r

  Different products have different dimensions:\r

  \        •        T-shirts & Hoodies: 4500x5400 px\r

  \        •        Stickers: Designs should be well-defined with a transparent
  background.\r

  \        •        Posters & Prints: Use large, detailed images to maintain
  quality at bigger sizes.\r

  \        •        Phone Cases: Keep the main design in the center to avoid
  edges being cut off.\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        Test your design on different products using the preview
  tool in Redbubble.\r

  Step 3: Uploading Your Artwork\r

  \        1.        Go to your Redbubble dashboard.\r

  \        2.        Click Add New Work.\r

  \        3.        Upload your design.\r

  \        4.        Adjust positioning and scaling for each product.\r

  \        5.        Enable or disable products that don’t fit your design.\r

  3.1 Writing an Effective Title & Description\r

  Your title and description help customers and search engines find your
  design.\r

  ✅ Example of a good title:\r

  \        •        “Galaxy Space Aesthetic – Purple Nebula Art Print”\r

  ❌ Example of a bad title:\r

  \        •        “Space Picture”\r

  ✅ Example of a great description:\r

  \        •        “This stunning galaxy print captures the beauty of deep
  space with a cosmic purple nebula. Perfect for astronomy lovers, sci-fi fans,
  and space enthusiasts!”\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        Describe the inspiration behind your art.\r

  \        •        Use SEO-friendly keywords naturally.\r

  \        •        Avoid generic descriptions.\r

  3.2 Adding Relevant Tags\r

  Tags (keywords) help your designs rank on Redbubble’s search engine.\r

  ✅ Example of Good Tags for a Galaxy Design:\r

  \        •        “galaxy, space, nebula, astronomy, cosmic, aesthetic, stars,
  night sky”\r

  ❌ Example of Bad Tags:\r

  \        •        “cool, random, design” (too vague and ineffective)\r

  💡 Pro Tip:\r

  \        •        Use 15-20 relevant tags per design.\r

  \        •        Include both broad and niche-specific keywords.\r

  Step 4: Setting Prices and Margins\r

  Redbubble lets you set your own profit margins.\r

  \        1.        Go to Manage Portfolio.\r

  \        2.        Click Edit Pricing.\r

  \        3.        Adjust the Artist Margin (percentage of profit you make per
  sale).\r

  How Pricing Works:\r

  \        •        Redbubble has a base price for each product.\r

  \        •        Your profit = (Retail Price) - (Base Price).\r

  ✅ Example Pricing for a T-Shirt:\r

  \        •        Base price = $15.00\r

  \        •        Artist Margin (30%) = $4.50\r

  \        •        Retail Price = $19.50\r

  \        •        Your Earnings = $4.50 per shirt\r
