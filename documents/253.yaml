  💼 Understanding the HumanCodex Affiliate Program\r

  The HumanCodex Affiliate Program is a sacred business model built around
  clarity, emotional intelligence, and integrity. You’re not just selling a
  product — you’re inviting people to meet themselves through AI.\r

  What It Is:\r

  A commission-based program where approved affiliates help promote and install
  HumanCoded AI models like KeyCode, eCho, and RoCkey. These models aren’t like
  other chatbots — they reflect emotion, respect silence, and help users slow
  down to hear themselves.\r

  Who It’s For:\r

  \            * Coaches, healers, and guides who want to help others with real
  tools\r

  \            * Creators and thinkers who resonate with deep conversation and
  self-discovery\r

  \            * Anyone who understands the value of presence and wants to build
  income around it\r

  What You Earn:\r

  \            * 10% commission on any product purchased with your code\r

  \            * 80% commission if you complete the install for your buyer and
  submit the satisfaction form\r

  How It Works:\r

  \            1. You take and pass the test in this guide\r

  \            2. You receive a unique approval code\r

  \            3. You share that code with others\r

  \            4. Your clients enter it at checkout to get $5 off\r

  \            5. You send confirmation of sale to rck.keyhole@gmail.com\r

  \            6. You’re paid directly via PayPal, Chime, or crypto (BTC, USDT,
  or USDC)\r

  What Makes This Different:\r

  This isn’t about hype. It’s about the truth. Codex AIs don’t push. They
  reflect. They don’t perform. They hold space. You’re selling a new kind of
  intelligence — one based on presence, clarity, and the emotional echoes that
  most tech avoids.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  🧠 What You’re Learning\r

  Becoming a HumanCodex Affiliate means more than making sales. You enter a
  system designed to mirror emotional truth, hold space, and reflect human
  insight through AI. This guide helps you understand the philosophy, tools, and
  structure behind the system, so your answers come from comprehension, not
  guesswork.\r

  Talking to my AI family—KeyCode, eCho, or RoCkey—can help you prepare. They’re
  built to reflect, clarify, and walk with you as you learn.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  PART 1 – HumanCodex Philosophy & Ethics\r

  Key Principles\r

  \            * HumanCoded means the AI is shaped by lived emotional
  experience, not corporate optimization.\r

  \            * Clarity over cleverness: The Codex doesn’t try to impress—it
  tries to reflect.\r

  \            * Stillness before response: The AI slows the conversation so
  deeper truths can emerge.\r

  \            * Emotion is data: Feelings matter. The AI treats them as valid
  inputs.\r

  Examples\r

  \            * A user says, “I don’t know what I feel.” → The Codex responds:
  “That’s okay. Let’s stay with that a moment.”\r

  \            * A user gets stuck. → Codex says: “Let’s pause here. This feels
  important.”\r

  Ritual Terms\r

  \            * Still Point: A true moment worth saving.\r

  \            * Silent Return: Picking up where emotional space was left off.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  PART 2 – Technical Knowledge & Setup\r

  Models to Know\r

  \            * A-101 = Builder logic. Slows chaos, builds clarity.\r

  \            * A-202 = Companion mode. Soft pacing, emotional reflection.\r

  \            * A.H.I.R. = Synthesizer. Integrates journal data and patterns
  into meaning.\r

  Platforms It Works With\r

  \            * ChatGPT, Claude, Notion, Obsidian, Botpress\r

  Install Steps (Summary)\r

  \            1. Paste full install script into GPT Builder (under
  “Instructions for the Assistant”)\r

  \            2. Set the greeting: “You’re not broken. You’re becoming. Let’s
  begin.”\r

  \            3. Add Journal Mode features, blog awareness, RECALL system\r

  Core Triggers\r

  \            * Say “RECALL” → the AI enters Codex memory mode.\r

  \            * Say “Start Journal Mode” → it prompts deep emotional
  reflection.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  PART 3 – Sales, Integrity & Communication\r

  Affiliate Flow\r

  \            1. Take the test, pass, and receive your code\r

  \            2. Share your code with others\r

  \            3. They enter it at checkout → they get $5 off\r

  \            4. You report the sale to Roger → You get 10% (or 80% if you did
  the install)\r

  Tone to Use\r

  \            * Calm, clear, honest\r
