  Computer science\r

  Unit 1 - Introduction\r

  In this unit students begin with an introduction to algorithms and to computer
  programs and languages. They are also introduced to the educational, graphical
  programming language, Snap!, which they will use throughout this course for
  hands-on experience with programming. They explore programming as a creative
  activity and program music and art in the Snap! language.\r

  Unit 2 - Abstraction\r

  Students study binary numbers and the concept of bits. They learn about text
  and the ASCII Table, about colors in the RGB system, and about numeric
  precision and round-off errors. They learn hexadecimal notation and how to
  convert between number bases. They explore logic gates and learn to make a
  half adder, as well as a full adder with overflow. They discover simulations,
  Conway's Game of Life, what \"random\" is, and they learn to program the roll
  of dice.\r

  Unit 3 - The Internet\r

  In this unit students begin to understand the characteristics and the spirit
  of the Internet. They learn important vocabulary and discuss Internet privacy
  in terms of cookies and proxy servers, Internet security, and intellectual
  property.\r

  Unit 4 - Artificial Intelligence (Algorithms and Programming)\r

  In this unit students explore artificial intelligence (AI). They begin by
  studying the Turing Test, and then dive into programming by creating a Mad
  Libs program. They learn about AI and decision trees, and learn to program a
  recommendation. They investigate AI and winning games, they study modulo
  arithmetic, and they program a game of stones. They consider whether we should
  fear AI, and they program a number guessing game.\r

  Unit 5 - Data and Information\r

  Students learn about Big Data in this unit. They learn about privacy issues
  with Big Data, and they are introduced to lists in the Snap! language. They
  learn to store simulation results in a list, they discover abstractions in
  programming, and they learn about the average and the maximum of a list of
  numbers. They explore linear and binary searches and learn to swap the values
  of two variables. They learn sorting algorithms, they learn how to code a
  bubble sort, and they investigate compression of data, lossless compression,
  lossy compression, and programming the compression of a sentence. They discuss
  becoming a Data Scientist and exploring Big Data web sites. They learn to
  download a CSV file into a spreadsheet, and they learn what can be determined
  from Big Data once it has been collected.\r

  Unit 6 - The Power and Limits of Computing\r

  In this unit students discover intractable problems. They learn about problems
  that cannot be solved within a reasonable time, about The Traveling
  Salesperson problem, and about hueristic solutions to intractable problems.
  They study unsolvable and undecidable problems, and the impact of computing on
  society. They explore cryptography and learn to program a Caesar Cipher. They

  strings with the “+”, comparing strings, and writing string methods.  The unit
  concludes by exploring the math class and the wrapper class.\r

  Unit 5\r

  This unit introduces arrays, discussing both one- and two-dimensional
  arrays.  Students learn how to traverse arrays, as well as to add to, delete
  from, and insert into an array.  Also covered are parallel arrays, arraylist
  methods, and writing a 2D array program.\r

  Unit 6\r

  This unit explores searching and sorting.  Students learn to perform a
  sequential search and a binary search.  Also discussed are programming a
  number search, recursion, and performing selection, insertion, bubble, and
  merge sorts, as well as coding for the selection sort.\r

  \r

  \r

  Unit 7 - Preparing for the College Board Assessments\r

  In this unit students learn about the performance tasks they will need to
  complete in preparation for the College Board Assessments, which will make up
  40% of their grade.  They explore the two required tasks:  the Explore
  Performance Task, which considers computing innovations, and the Create
  Performance Task, which focuses on the creation of a computer program.  They
  discuss the requirements for submitting the Performance Tasks in the digital
  portfolio.\r

  project manager for guidance. She explains that one of the primary differences

  across several Agile teams. What did he likely suggest?\r

  \ A. Flow based agile management\r

  \ B. Product Backlog controls\r

  \ C. Monte Carlo controls\r

  \ D. Scrum of Scrums\r

  backlog, but it does normally use a tool that is common to backlog based
  Agile. He is most likely describing what?\r

  \ A. Sprint\r

  employees in your regional call center. Your team has been working closely
  with the Product Owner to ensure all the features planned for the next release

  type of requirement did you likely miss?\r

  \ A. Compliance\r

  \ B. Functional\r

  \ C. Business\r

  \ D. Project\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  46. Story points are often used by agile teams to determine the level of
  effort for a user story or task. After several sprints, the Scrum Master would
  like to forecast when the next release in the Product Roadmap will be ready,
  and does this by averaging the number of story points in all of the prior team
  sprints and comparing that to the work remaining in the product backlog. The
  average number of story points an Agile team is completing in their sprints is
  referred to as what?\r

  \ A. Throughput\r

  \ B. Cycle Time\r

  value. You use those features to develop a high-level schedule of what
  functionality will be delivered and roughly when it will be delivered. You
  have just completed the _________ ___________.\r

  \ A. Product Roadmap\r

  \ B. Product Backlog\r

  \ C. Product Baseline\r

  \ D. Agile schedule\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  48. You conducted an analysis of the progress of your team. You realize that
  at the current pace of development, the estimated date of the next release
  will be delayed substantially. You approach the Agile Coach about the
  possibility of approving overtime so the team can get back on track. To your
  surprise, they disagree with that approach. They state that approving overtime
  or applying additional resources violates one of the principles of the Agile
  Manifesto. Which principle did it violate?\r

  \ A. At regular intervals, the team readjusts their commitments based on
  actual performance.\r

  \ B. Agile processes promote sustainable development.\r

  \ C. The Kanban Board is the primary measure of progress\r

  \ D. Build projects around motivated individuals. Whatever they say is the
  law.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  49. You have just completed discussing your project with a colleague who is
  using a waterfall approach on his project. You are curious about their use of
  Earned Value to use current project performance as a basis for forecasting
  future performance. You wonder if Earned Value can be used for an Agile
  project, so you ask your Scrum Master. They state:\r

  \ A. No, because we do not measure completed work in Agile\r

  \ B. Yes, but you can not determine Earned Value, Planned Value or Actual
  Cost\r

  \ C. Yes, you can use Earned Value for an Agile project.\r

  \ D. Yes, but it is impossible to compute CV and SV.\r

  ________________\r

  \r

  \r

  50. You have assembled your Agile team and are beginning to determine your Way
  of Working. You hold a meeting to discuss what method you will use to
  estimate, establish team norms and coordinate with the product owner. What is
  this initial meeting called?\r

  \ A. Planning Poker\r

  \ B. Forecasting sprint\r

  \ C. Original Sprint\r

  \ D. Sprint 0\r
