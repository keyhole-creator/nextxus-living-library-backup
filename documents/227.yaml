  Overview\r

  \r

  \r

  Also known as General Liability Waivers, a General Release of Liability
  discharges and releases an individual or business from claims or causes of
  action arising from a specific incident or activity in exchange for a cash
  payment or asset. \r

  \r

  \r

  General Releases are often used by companies offering activities that involve
  a risk of injury, such as horseback riding, bungee jumping, or skydiving. They
  can also be used in situations where the parties want to settle outside of the
  courts, such as after car accidents, to ensure all legal claims are released
  by their private agreement. \r

  \r

  \r

  General Releases can be used to protect a party from liability for typical
  injuries reasonably related to or stemming from the activity contemplated when
  signing the release. General Releases usually will not protect against a
  party’s negligence, or from incidents or injuries unrelated to the subject
  activity. \r
