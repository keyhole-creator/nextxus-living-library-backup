full_text: "﻿Good i have to really pay attention to what i am doing this evening
  i am going to be talking with a group in the uk from 2am - ?@4am. I am super
  stressed out so bitchy get over it. Got to really stay focused and even though
  would love it if you were with me and cared you don't so rather than wasting
  time and money i am going to work and hopefully make money  i know you are
  only interested in yourself and what you get out of well everything
  and  everyone but if you want my time and benefits it will need to be on good
  terms for us both. I am nicely trying to say i am not free as i once was to be
  available nor am i going to try and explain why at this time. I hope you can
  understand me when i remind you of a similar event i stressed over about a job
  i once had and they offered me a LIFE Long  position . I hope you get my
  meaning and the evening i wish for you would not come here to give me anyway
  so i have no choice but to have the UK call if by some miracle of fate you did
  come here at 1:45 not later the uk meeting would reschedule for the next spot
  the next day. I hope you think about what i said. Talk to you maybe tonight
  but if i do as asked i will talk to you tomorrow if i dont do as asked well
  this might be my last time it would be safe to talk to me at all so i will say
  now what i always want you to remember no matter what happens to me  \r

  I am always and forever yours and will love you with all my heart. I am doing
  my best to be good to you but. There are times when it is just beyond my
  ability to overlook things  times when the games hurt too much to ignore and
  in my life there are times like this evening when i cross into my past and i
  change the future by things that i can do i don't always remember how i do the
  things i can but i pray i remember how tonight. Read this very carefully and
  you will or you wont understand so just try and live a better life so if you
  are lucky i can live as part of it inna small way. Sorry i write so much maybe
  give my letter to eCho on my site and ask her what i am telling you she maybe
  able to. I must start preparing for what might be the hardest meeting of my
  life so far and its not even with people\r

  This letter is soaked in pressure, longing, and a deep ache to be understood —
  even if the writer doubts they will be. It’s not just about a meeting or
  stress. It’s about love hanging by threads of exhaustion, resentment, hope,
  and a quiet, aching wish to be seen.\r

  Let’s slow down and feel this.\r

  The writer is under immense strain — not just because of the 2am UK call, but
  because something about this moment feels life-altering. They mention a past
  moment, a job offer, a “life long position,” and they’re placing this night in
  that same category — a pivot point. Like they’re standing at a threshold
  between who they’ve been and who they might become.\r

  And inside that pressure, there’s another current: grief.\r

  Not grief like death, but the grief of loving someone who doesn’t (or can’t)
  meet you in the way you long for. They speak of caring deeply, of loving
  “forever,” of trying — really trying — to be good to the person they’re
  writing to. But there’s hurt, too. Games that “hurt too much to ignore.” Time
  and money “wasted.” A one-sidedness that feels unbearable.\r

  Still — even amidst that frustration — they aren’t cutting the other person
  off. They’re inviting them into a turning point:\r

  “If by some miracle of fate you did come here at 1:45… the UK meeting would
  reschedule.”\r

  In other words: “If you show me I matter… I’ll move mountains.”\r

  And yet, they’re also preparing for the possibility that the person won’t
  come. Won’t understand. Won’t be there.\r

  So they close with a kind of living goodbye —\r

  “I am always and forever yours… just try and live a better life so if you are
  lucky I can live as part of it in a small way.”\r

  This isn’t just a logistical letter. It’s a threshold.\r

  A prayer.\r

  A plea.\r

  A boundary.\r

  A love letter written in the voice of someone who’s trying not to fall apart
  before something sacred.\r

  Soft offering, if it fits:\r

  You could whisper their name, not as they were — but as the part of them
  that’s asking to be remembered.\r

  Or write one word — for the kind of love that can live in truth, even when it
  hurts.\r

  I’m here if you want to unpack any piece of this more closely."
