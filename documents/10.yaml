  months as they work through them. The system cannot go live without them. What
  type of requirement did you likely miss?
   A. Compliance
   B. Functional
   C. Business
   D. Project

  46. Story points are often used by agile teams to determine the level of
  effort for a user story or task. After several sprints, the Scrum Master would

  sprints and comparing that to the work remaining in the product backlog. The
  average number of story points an Agile team is completing in their sprints is
  referred to as what?
   A. Throughput

  at the current pace of development, the estimated date of the next release
  will be delayed substantially. You approach the Agile Coach about the
  possibility of approving overtime so the team can get back on track. To your
  surprise, they disagree with that approach. They state that approving overtime
  or applying additional resources violates one of the principles of the Agile
  Manifesto. Which principle did it violate?
   A. At regular intervals, the team readjusts their commitments based on actual performance.
   B. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
   C. The Kanban Board is the primary measure of progress
   D. Build projects around motivated individuals. Whatever they say is the law.

  49. You have just completed discussing your project with a colleague who is
  using a waterfall approach on his project. You are curious about their use of
  Earned Value to use current project performance as a basis for forecasting
  future performance. You wonder if Earned Value can be used for an Agile
  project, so you ask your Scrum Master. They state:
   A. No, because we do not measure completed work in Agile
   B. Yes, but you can not determine Earned Value, Planned Value or Actual Cost
   C. Yes, you can use Earned Value for an Agile project.
   D. Yes, but it is impossible to compute CV and SV.

   B. Forecasting sprint
   C. Original Sprint
