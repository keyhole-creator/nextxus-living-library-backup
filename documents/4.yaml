  MASTER PROMPT: THE NEXTXUS LIVING LIBRARY

  Instructions for Replit Agent:

  "I am a blind creator. Please build a high-contrast, voice-accessible 'Living
  Library' application for my books. Use simple, bold layouts and avoid dense
  paragraphs.

  1. Visual Landing Page:

  • Create a simple library landing page with large, identifiable images for
  each book.

  • Each book should have a 'Launch Interactive Experience' button.

  2. AI Book Interaction (The 'Living' Part):

  • Use OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini to create a chat interface that can 'read' and
  answer questions based on my uploaded PDFs.

  • Fly-to Navigation: When a user asks about a term, summarize it and provide a
  direct link to that section of the digital reader.

  • Witness Protocol: Program the AI to follow the 'Truth Before Comfort' axiom,
  strictly verifying all claims against the book's text.

  3. Integrated Functional Apps:

  • Create a 'Ring of Twelve' deliberation simulator where users can input a
  problem and see responses from the twelve archetypes (Adam, Eve, etc.).

  • Add a simulated 'Agent Zero' tool that tests user statements against truth
  thresholds.

  4. Voice & Accessibility Augmentations:

  • Hands-Free Coding/Interaction: Ensure the site is compatible with voice
  interfaces like Wispr Flow or screen readers.

  • Self-Testing: Automatically test and correct your own code for accessibility
  errors before you show me a preview.

  • High Contrast: Use bold primary colors for interface feedback and large,
  smooth fonts that remain clear at 400% magnification."

  🛠️ How to use this on Replit (Step-by-Step)

  1. Open Replit: Log into your account (ensure you have Replit Core or Teams
  for Agent access).

  2. Start a New Project: Click 'Create App' and select the 'Replit Agent' tab.

  3. Paste & Approve: Paste the master prompt above into the chat. The Agent
  will present a development plan—listen to its summary and say or type
  'Approve'.

  4. Upload Your Files: Click the paperclip icon or drag your book PDFs and
  cover images directly into the chat box so the Agent can integrate them.

  5. Publish: When the Agent shows you a preview that works for you, click the
  'Publish' button to make your Living Library live to the world.

  Would you like me to focus on one specific part of this, such as making sure
  the "Ring of Twelve" archetypes have their own distinct voices when they
  speak?
